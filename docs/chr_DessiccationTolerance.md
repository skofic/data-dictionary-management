#### Risk of desiccation during drought



------
###### The simulated probability that GCU's trees reach treshold mortality over the past 30 years is used to compute of probability of death by dessication.



------
Risk of dessication is related to the risk for the trees of a given GCU to loose their ability to transport water during drought. This phenomenom occurs during extreme drought because of the xylem embolsim and can trigger the complete death the tree. In this case the risk is modelled using the SurEau model for the past 30 years and the value provided is a probability of death (between 0 and 1). The probability is taken as the frequency of years with percent embolism overpassing 50% loss of hydraulic conductance. The SurEau model integrates different traits, soil and climatic data to estimate soil and plant water status at an hourly time step and derives the percent loss of hydraulic conductance.
