###### Simulated loss of hydraulic conductance



------
The risk of tree desiccation during drought is related to the hydraulic failure which refers to the trees losing their ability to transport water during extreme drought. This phenomenon occurs during extreme drought due to xylem embolism (obstruction by air due to cavitation) and can trigger the complete death of the tree. Here, this risk is taken as the yearly maximum percent loss of hydraulic conductance of the plant (between 0 and 100 %). The closer to 100 the higher the risk. In general we assume that conifers die at 50% loss of hydraulic conductance whereas angioperms die at 90% loss of hydraulic conductance.
