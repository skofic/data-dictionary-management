#### Risk of desiccation during drought

###### Simulated probability of death by dessication



------
The risk of desiccation is related to the risk that trees lose their ability to transport water during drought. This phenomenon occurs during extreme drought due to sap vessel embolsim (obstruction) and can trigger the complete death of the tree. In this case, the risk is modelled using the SurEau model for the last 30 years and the value provided is a probability of death (between 0 and 1). The probability is taken as the frequency of years in which the percentage of embolisms exceeds 50%. To do this, the SurEau model integrates various trait, soil and climate data to estimate soil and plant water status at an hourly time step and derives the percentage of embolism resulting in a loss of hydraulic fluxes/conductance.
