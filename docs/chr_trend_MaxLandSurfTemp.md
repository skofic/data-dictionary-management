###### Temporal changes of the maximum canopy surface temperature in degree and per month



------
The changes in land surface temperature per month are given in degrees and indicate whether the canopy tends to warm up or cool down over time. If the value is positive, the canopy tends to warm up. If the sign is negative, the canopy tends to cool down. The surface temperature of the tree canopy is estimated by a sensor on the MODIS satellite, which measures the thermal infrared emissions of the vegetation. The maximum canopy surface temperature can serve as an indicator of drought and heat stress in a forest, as the canopy heats up when the water supply to the trees is insufficient to cool the leaves.
