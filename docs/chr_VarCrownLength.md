#### Crown length variance

###### The variance of the crown lenght across all measured trees



------
The variance of the values of  the crown lenght across 10 measured adult dominant or co-dominant trees sampled either inside or in the vicinity of the representative circular plot with a radius of 15 m. The crown lenght is calculated from the [total height] value subtracted from the [Basal crown height] value. It corresponds to the healthy and functional green crown envelope lenght.
