#### GCU originality - population specific Fst



------
###### Level of genetic differentiation of the target population from an ideal ancestral population from which all populations in the species diverged



------
Genetic differentiation of a population is determined by the accumulation of independent genetic changes (mutations) or maintenance of unique variants through time. For instance a population living in an ecologically distinct environment can exhibit genetic divergence from the other studied populations. Fst ranges from 0 (complete similarity of alleles/variants) to 1 (no overalp of alleles/variants). Population-specific Fst values can identify the source/ancestral population and trace the evolutionary history of its derived populations. The measure is relative to the dataset analysed simultaneously and changes when new GCUs are added to the dataset. Population specific Fst was calculated with BayeScan (Foll & Gagiotti 2008) in R.
