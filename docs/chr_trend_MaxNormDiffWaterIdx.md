### chr_trend_MaxNormDiffWaterIdx



------
#### Trend (temporal dynamics) in annual maximum of monthly GCU averaged NDWI



------
###### Temporal trends of the annual max of monthly remotely sensed Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).



------
Slope of the relationship between yearly maximum of monthly remotely sensed NDWI over the GCU and time (NDWI/year).

Beware that for some GCUs there are no shapefile available so that the average Land surface temperature over a 5 km buffer around the GCU coordinate is taken.
