###### The sapwood area of the tree at 1.30m height based on the measurement of the length of the sapwood estimated from a wood core.

Sapwood areas is calculated from:

- the under-bark total lenght of the core measured on the tree ring core after collection.
- the sapwood lenght measured on the tree ring core after collection.
- the bark lenght measured on the tree ring core after collection.

The calculation of sapwood area is weighted by the value of the breast height trunk circumference.
