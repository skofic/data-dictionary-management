#### Population contribution to molecular diversity between-component

###### Contribution of target population to global molecular diversity based on the distinctiveness component.



------
A molecular diversity partition into diversity per se and distinctiness is defined by using molecular markers. Then the contribution of each population to the global diversity is computed by removing one population at a time. This statistics refers to the population distinctiveness. The measure is relative to the dataset analysed simultaneously and changes when new GCUs are added to the dataset.
