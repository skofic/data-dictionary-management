###### Contribution of one population to the total diversity due to its divergence/distinctiveness



------
A molecular diversity partition into diversity per se and distinctiness is defined by using molecular markers. Then the contribution of each population to the total (global) diversity is computed by removing one population at a time. This statistics refers to the population distinctiveness (variation between populations). The measure is relative to the dataset analysed simultaneously and changes when new GCUs are added to the dataset. The index was calculated with metapop2 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.13015). Reference: Petit et al. 1998 (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.96489.x)
