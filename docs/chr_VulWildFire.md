###### The simulated GCU's canopy fuel moisture content which is a key driver of fire ignition and spread if there is an ignition source



------
Vulnerability to wildfire refers to the probability that a GCU will dry out in such a way that the probability of fire increases, if there is ignition and the wind speed is significant. This vulnerability is approximated by the modelled moisture content (g of water /g of leaf dry matter) of the canopy leaves of the GCU using the SurEau model. When the canopy moisture content reaches values below 66% the risk of flammability drastically increases. Here we provide yearly minimum values of fuel moisture content. These values depend on the physiological characteristics of the trees and the climatic drynesss of the year which are all counted for by the SurEau model.
