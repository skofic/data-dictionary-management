#### Vulnerability to wild fire

###### The simulated probability that the GCU's canopy water content reaches a treshold facilitating fire ignition and spread if there is an ignition source



------
This risk refers to the probability that a GCU will dry out in such a way that the probability of fire increases, if there is ignition and the wind speed is significant. This risk is mainly related to the modelled desiccation of the GCU. The simulated minimum canopy water content during extreme drought is used as an indicator of wildfire susceptibility. The simulations of canopy water content over the past 30 years were used to derive the frequency of years in which canopy moisture content exceeds the risk threshold (50% moisture content on a dry matter basis). Simulations were carried out using the SurEau model. The SurEau model integrates various traits, soil and climate data to estimate soil and plant water status at an hourly time step and derives the percentage loss of hydraulic conductance.
