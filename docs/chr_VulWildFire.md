#### Vulnerability to wild fire



------
###### The simulated probability that the GCU's canopy water content reaches a treshold facilitating fire ignition and spread if there is an ignition sources.



------
This risk relates to the probability a forest GCU dessicate so much that this increases its probability to burn if an ignition is there and wind speed signifcant. Hencde this risk is mostly related to the modelled dessication of the GCU. The simulated minimum water content of the canopy furing extreme drought is taken as an indicator of the vulnerability to wildfire. The simulations of water content of the canopy over the past thirty years were used to derive the freduency of years where canopy moistrure content overpass treshold for risk (50% moisture content on a dry mass area basis). Simulations have been made with the SurEau model. The SurEau model integrates different traits, soil and climatic data to estimate soil and plant water status at an hourly time step and derives the percent loss of hydraulic conductance.
