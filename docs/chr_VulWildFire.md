#### Vulnerability to wild fire



------
###### The simulated GCU's canopy fuel moisture content which is a key driver of fire ignition and spread if there is an ignition source



------
This risk refers to the probability that a GCU will dry out in such a way that the probability of fire increases, if there is ignition and the wind speed is significant. This risk is approximated by the modelled moisture content (g of water /g of leaf dry matter) of the canopy leaves of the GCU using the SurEau model. When the canopy moisture content reaches values below 66% the risk of flammability drastically increases. Here we provide yearly values of fuel moisture content.
