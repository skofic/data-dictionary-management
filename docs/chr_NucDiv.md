Nucleotide diversity (π) measures the degree of polymorphism within a population and is defined as the average number of nucleotide differences per site between any two DNA sequences of the same genomic region, chosen randomly from the selected population. This parameter is a measure of genetic variation, in a similar way to Hs. One commonly used measure of nucleotide diversity was first introduced by: Nei M, Li WH. (1979).
