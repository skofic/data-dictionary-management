#### Nucleotide diversity - π

###### Mean number of nucleotide substitutions per site between any two randomly selected orthologous DNA sequences (of the same loci) in a population (π).



------
Nucleotide diversity (π) measures the degree of polymorphism within a population and is defined as the average number of nucleotide differences per site between any two DNA sequences of the same genomic region, chosen randomly from the selected population. This parameter is a measure of genetic variation, in a similar way to expected heterozygosity.
