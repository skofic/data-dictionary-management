###### Temporal trends of the remotely sensed Normalized Difference Water Index.



------
Global variation in normalized difference water index (NDWI) for the whole GCU, to observe long-terme trends of vegetation water content. NDWI provides an effective measure of moisture content. This index is calculated on the basis of the GREEN-NIR combination (visible green and near infrared spectrum) and enables the detection of water pools as well as subtle changes in the water content of vegetation. These values (from MODIS at 1km resolution) range from -1 (no water) to 1 (water surface), and their variation is a very good indicator of plant water stress.
