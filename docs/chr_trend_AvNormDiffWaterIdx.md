------
#### Trend (temporal dynamics) in annual mean of GCU averaged NDWI



------
###### Temporal trends of the annual mean remotely sensed NDWI.



------
Slope of the relationship between yearly mean remotely sensed NDWI over the GCU and time (NDWI/year).

Beware that for some GCUs there are no shapefile available so that the average Land surface temperature over a 5 km buffer around the GCU coordinate is taken.
