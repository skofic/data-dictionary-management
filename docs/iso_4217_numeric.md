DESCRIPTION

------

[ISO 4217]([ISO 4217 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)) also assigns a three-digit numeric code to each currency, much like the three-digit numeric code assigned to each country by [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166 "ISO 3166"). The numeric code assigned to a currency by ISO 4217 is usually the same as the numeric code assigned to the corresponding country by [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1 "ISO 3166-1"). For example, USD ([United States dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar")) has numeric code 840 which is also the numeric code for the US (United States).
