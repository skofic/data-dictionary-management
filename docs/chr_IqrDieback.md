#### Dieback InterQuartile Range

###### The InterQuartile Range of the dieback index across all measured trees



------
The InterQuartile Range of the values of the dieback index across 10 measured adult dominant or co-dominant trees sampled either inside or in the vicinity of the representative circular plot with a radius of 15 m. The dieback index corresponds to the state of health of the trees determined by assessing foliage loss according to four classes:
0: 0 to 25% of defoliation
1: 25 to 50% of defoliation
2: 50 to 75 % of defoliation
3: 75% to 99% of defoliation
The value 100% corresponds to a dead tree.
