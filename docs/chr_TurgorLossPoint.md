#### Leaf turgor loss point



------
###### The water potential at which leaves lose turgor.



------
Turgor loss point is an index of sensitivity of leaves to drought. It always has negative values. High (close to zero) values indicates high sensitivity to loss of turgor in leaves under drought. Smaller (more negative) values indicate greater drought tolerance. It is measured in the leaves taken from apical branches of each tree. The point of turgor loss is measured by osmometry on sap extracted from leaves. It has units of pressure (MegaPascals).

This tree level property can also be averaged across trees to provide an equivalent GCU-level estimate (with associated variance).
