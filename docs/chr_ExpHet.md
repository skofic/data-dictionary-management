#### Genetic diversity - expected heterozygosity



------
###### Proportion of heterozygous genotypes expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium corrected by sample size



------
The expected heterozygosity is known also as the gene diversity of a locus. It is a fundamental measure of genetic variation in a population and explains the proportion of heterozygous genotypes expected under random mating. The value is corrected for sample size.
