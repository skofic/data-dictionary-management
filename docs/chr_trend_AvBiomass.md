###### Temporal trends of the above-ground biomass of all species



------
Biomass annual trends in above ground biomass for the whole GCU, to define and quantify whether the forest can be considered a carbon sink (increase in biomass) or a carbon source (decrease in biomass). The above ground biomasse (in t/ha) includes all of the vegetation present and in forest makes it possible to quantitatively consider the importance of wood.
