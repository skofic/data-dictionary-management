#### Xylem vulnerability to embolism



------
###### The water potential at which 50% of the xylem hydraulic conductivity is lost.

 When a stem is drought stressed, it begins to form air bubbles inside its conduits, like in the blood of divers. These bubbles prevents the tree from being able to transport water from roots to leaves. If this continues, the tree eventually dessiccates at the top. The easyness by which these bubbles are formed is called vulnerability to embolism. It is an index of drought sensitivity (the inverse of resistance) of the wood of plants. Vulnerability to embolism is always a negative number. High values (close to zero) indicate high sensitivity to drought stress. Low values (more negative) indicate greater drought resistance. Tree level data. It is measured using a rotary instrument called cavitron. It is measured in the apical branches of each tree.

This tree level property can also be averaged across trees to provide an equivalent GCU-level estimate (with associated variance).
