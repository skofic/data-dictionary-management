###### The current level of genetic differentiation whithin a species



------
Genetic differentiation of a population is determined by the accumulation of independent genetic changes (mutations) or maintenance of unique variants through time. For instance a population living in an ecologically distinct environment can exhibit genetic divergence from the other studied populations. Fst ranges from 0 (complete similarity of alleles/variants) to 1 (no overalp of alleles/variants). Pairwise Fst provides insight into the current population genetic structure. The measure is relative to the dataset analysed simultaneously and changes when new GCUs are added to the dataset. Pairwise Fst was calculated with package hierfstat in R.
