#### Surface net solar radiation



------
###### Amount of solar radiation reaching the surface of the Earth minus the amount reflected by the Earth's surface.



------
Amount of *solar radiation* (also known as *shortwave radiation*) reaching the *surface of the Earth* (both *direct* and *diffuse*) minus the amount *reflected by the Earth's surface* (which is governed by the albedo).

Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The difference between downward and reflected solar radiation is the surface net solar radiation.

This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are kilo-joules per square metre (KJ m-2).

To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.
