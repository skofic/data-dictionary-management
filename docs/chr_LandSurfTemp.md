Remotely sensed *monthly average* land surface temperature in *Kelvin*. The monthly average is calculated for the GCU area defined with the polygon of GCU boundaries. Beware that for some GCU (i) there are no shapefile available so that the average Land surface temperature over a 5km buffer around the GCU coordinate is taken.
