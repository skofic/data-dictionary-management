### _path



------
#### Relationship paths



------
###### Set of path roots that share the edge.



------
[Edges](_edge.md) are uniquely identified by their [subject](_from.md), [predicate](_predicate.md) and [object](_to.md) combination. In order to have more than one graph share the same edge, we list in this field all the graph *root* [nodes](_id.md) whose path uses the edge.

This property represents the *set* of all *graphs* that *share* this specific [edge](_edge.md).
