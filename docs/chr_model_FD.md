#### Frost damage



------
###### The simulated percentage of leaf buds killed by one or more frost events during the year.

The vulnerability of buds to late frosts depends on the stage of bud development. We model with CASTANEA the process of dormancy breaking during which this vulnerability increases. The damage is then calculated by crossing the vulnerability of the buds and the minimum temperatures.
