#### Leaf residual conductance



------
###### The leaf water vapour conductance remaining after stomatal closure.



------
Residual (or minimum) conductance is an index of drought resistance and it is measured by weight loss under standard conditions. Tree level data.



------
This tree level property can also be averaged across trees to provide an equivalent GCU-level estimate (with associated variance).
