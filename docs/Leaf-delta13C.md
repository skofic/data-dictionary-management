#### Leaf delta 13C



------
###### The isotopic ratio of 13C to the more abundant 12C carbon atoms relative to a standard reference material in per mils in leaf samples.



------
Leaf delta13C is obtained by mass spectrometry of dried and ground leaf samples. Being relative to a standard reference material, it is always negative.
