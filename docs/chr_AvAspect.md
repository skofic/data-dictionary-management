*Aspect* in *degrees* extracted from the [Digital Elevation Model](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/d08852bc-7b5f-4835-a776-08362e2fbf4b) (EU-DEM Copernicus Land Monitoring Service 25 meter resolution dataset). The *average* is calculated for the GCU area defined with the polygon of GCU boundaries.  Beware that for some GCU (i) there are no shapefile available so that the average elvevation over a 5km buffer around the GCU coordinate is taken (ii) it may happen that GCU visited by the wield team (WP2) does not fall in the shapefile available on EUFGIS, this mismatch is reported.
