#### Description

------

###### A long text or document explaining how the descriptor value is obtained, and how its data can be used.

------

The description is the area in which everything that could not be included in the [definition](_definition) should be presented. This should be an occasion to explain *why* the descriptor value is *used*, which measurement *methods* were used to obtain the values and all the other details that would allow a *non specialist* user *understand* how to *use* and *provide* such data.

The contents are a *key/value dictionary* in which the *key* represents the *language* in which the description is expressed, and the *value* is the description text formatted in *markup*.
