### env_climate_soil_temp_289



------
#### Soil temperature from 100 to 289cm.



------
###### Temperature of the soil in layer 4 (100-289 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.



------
The surface is at 0 cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them.

It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer.
