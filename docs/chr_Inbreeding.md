Inbreeding is the production of offspring from the mating or breeding of individuals that are closely related genetically. The degree of inbreeding can be measured using a calculation called the inbreeding coefficient. This calculates the probability that two copies of a gene variant have been inherited from an ancestor common to both the mother and the father. The lower the degree of inbreeding, the lower the inbreeding coefficient. Negative values indicate no inbreeding. Reference: Wright (1921) Systems of Mating.
