DESCRIPTION

------

Each former country name in ISO 3166-3 is assigned a four-letter alphabetic code. The first two letters are the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 "ISO 3166-1 alpha-2") code of the former country, while the last two letters are allocated according to the following rules:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-3#cite_note-2)

- If the country changed its name, the new ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code is used, or the special code AA is used if its alpha-2 code was not changed.
- If the country merged into an existing country, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of this country is used.
- If the country was divided into several parts, the special code HH is used to indicate that there is no single successor country, with the exception of [Serbia and Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_and_Montenegro "Serbia and Montenegro"), for which XX is used to avoid duplicate use of the same ISO 3166-3 code, as the alpha-2 code CS had twice been deleted from ISO 3166-1, the first time due to the split of Czechoslovakia and the second time due to the split of Serbia and Montenegro.
