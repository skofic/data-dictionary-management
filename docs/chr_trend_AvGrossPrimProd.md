###### Temporal trends of the  Gross Primary Productivity



------
Linear temporal trend in gross primary productivity (GPP) for the whole GCU, which is a key indicator of whether or not the forest is growing and storing carbon. The Gross Primary Productivity (kg of C/m2/day) corresponds to the amount of carbon produced in the ecosystem per unit surface and time. This value is derived from the satellite MODIS at 1 km resolution that provides the fraction of light intercepted by the canopy and a model of photosynthesis that converts the intercepted light in to a carbon assimilation. This makes it possible to define the amount of energy available for the plant to function (respiration) and the amount available for growth (net primary productivity).
