#### Container predicate



------
###### Non functional edge predicate that acts as a container or category for a set of elements



------
Edges have three types of predicates: *functional*, *container* and *bridge*.

*Container predicates* do not define any function in the graph, they serve as *display sections* or *menu containers* for providing *organisation* to the *graph elements*. For instance a controlled vocabulary of countries could be difided into regions: these regions cannot be selected as elements of the controlled vocabulary, but they can be used as organisers when the numner of available choices is large.
