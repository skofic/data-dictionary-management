#### Admixture index - proportion of ancestry of detected gene pools



------
###### Proportion of population's ancestry in each gene pool of the target species



------
Measurement of the extent of admixture of individuals in a population belonging to different gene pools when individuals from two or more parental (ancestral) populations interbreed. The gene pool is the set of all genes, or genetic information in a group of individuals. The value given is the average population ancestry in each of the gene pools detected in the target tree species and is calculated with the R package LEA using the function sNMF. Depending on the number and distribution of populations in the analysis, the proportion of population's ancestry in each of the detected gene pools may change. The number of gene pools detected may also change.
