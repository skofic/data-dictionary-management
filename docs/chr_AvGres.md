###### The mean of the leaf water vapour conductance remaining after stomatal closure across all measured trees



------
The mean of the values of leaf residual conductance for the apical leaves of 10 measured adult dominant or co-dominant trees sampled either inside or in the vicinity of the representative circular plot with a radius of 15 m. During a severe drought, following the closure of the stomata, trees continue slowly to lose water. A high residual conductance implies a high sensitivity to severe droughts because it favours desiccation.
