Genetic load is a measure of the reduction of fitness caused by genetic erosion. It can be due to the increase in frequency of deleterious mutations due to random genetic drift and/or inbreeding. It is calculated by first identifying deleterious mutations via prediction of their effects, and then deriving deleterious scores that can be summarized to produce a load index, in this case the counts of derived deleterious mutations in homozygosis corrected by the number of synonymous ones.
