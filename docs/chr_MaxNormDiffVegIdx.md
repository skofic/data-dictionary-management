###### Maximum of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index



------
Monthly maximum value for the whole GCU, to quantify the seasonal variation in the health and density of the vegetation. The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a widely used metric based on remote sensing and is calculated as the normalised difference of spectrometric reflectance measurements in two specific bands: one in which the leaf absorbs light (red) and one in which the leaf absorbs little light (near infrared). The spectrometric data comes from MODIS satellites. The NDVI value varies between -1 (for water) and 1 for dense vegetation. A value close to 0 indicates rocks or poorly vegetated areas.
