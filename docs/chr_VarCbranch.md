###### The variance of the change in branch relative water content (RWC) per unit change in water potential across all measured trees



------
The variance  of the values of hydraulic capacitance for the apical branches of 10 measured adult dominant or co-dominant trees sampled either inside or in the vicinity of the representative circular plot with a radius of 15 m. Capacitance is the change in % relative water content (i.e., water content relative to its maximum value at saturation) per unit change in water potential. During a severe drought, if capacitance is high, the tree is capable of exploiting its own water reserves to delay desiccation.
