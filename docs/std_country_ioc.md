The [International Olympic Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee "International Olympic Committee") (IOC) uses [three-letter abbreviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_abbreviation "Three-letter abbreviation") [country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_codes "Country codes") to refer to each group of athletes that participate in the [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games "Olympic Games"). Each [geocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocode "Geocode") usually identifies a [National Olympic Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Olympic_Committee "National Olympic Committee") (NOC), but there are several codes that have been used for other instances in past Games, such as teams composed of athletes from multiple nations, or groups of athletes not formally representing any nation.
