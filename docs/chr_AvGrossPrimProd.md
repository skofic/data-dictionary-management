###### Monthly average of the Gross Primary Productivity



------
Monthly average gross primary productivity (GPP) for the whole GCU, to establish the seasonal variation in photosynthesis. The GPP (kg of C/m2/day) corresponds to the amount of carbon that enters the ecosystem per unit surface and time. This value is derived from the sattelite MODIS at 500 m. resolution that provides the fraction of light intercepted by the canopy and a model of photosynthesis that converts the intercepted light into carbon assimilation. This makes it possible to define the amount of energy available for the plant to function (respiration) and the amount available for growth (net primary productivity). Beware that this value is known to be incorrect during drought stress periods.
