### env_climate_hcwi_max



------
#### Heat and Cold Wave Index (HCWI) daily maximum temperature.

###### This index is used to detect and monitor periods of extreme-temperature anomalies (i.e. heat and cold waves) that can have strong impacts on human activities and health.

The *Heat and Cold Wave Index (HCWI)* that is implemented in the [Copernicus European Drought Observatory (EDO)](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/php/index.php?id=1000) is used to detect and monitor periods of extreme-temperature anomalies (i.e. heat and cold waves) that can have strong impacts on human activities and health. The [HCWI indicator](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/factsheets/factsheet_heatColdWaveIndex.pdf) is computed for each location (grid-cell), using the methodology developed by Lavaysse et al. (2018), based on the persistence for at least three consecutive days of events with both daily minimum and maximum temperatures (Tmin and Tmax) above the 90th percentile daily threshold (for heat waves) or below the 10th percentile daily threshold (for cold waves). For each location, the daily threshold values for Tmin and Tmax are derived from a 30-year climatological baseline period (1981-2010), using the JRCâ€™s MARS AGRI4CAST database of daily meteorological observations.
