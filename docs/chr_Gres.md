###### The leaf water vapour conductance remaining after stomatal closure.

When a branch is under severe drought stress, it does not have the capacity to entirely stop its water losses. The branch continues to lose water slowly from the surfaces of its leaves and bark. This eventually leads to dessiccation and death of the living cells. Residual (or minimum) leaf conductance is an index of lack of drought resistance (its inverse, i.e., residual resistance, is an index of drought resistance). High values of conductance (low values of resistance) indicate a reduced capacity to minimise these losses. Small values (close to zero) indicate a high capacity to withstand long droughts. The residual conductance is the rate at which this unavoidable evaporation takes place. It is measured by weight loss under standard conditions in the laboratory. It is measured in the apical branches of each tree.

This tree level property can also be averaged across trees to provide an equivalent GCU-level estimate (with associated variance).
