#### Soil Moisture Index (SMI).



------
###### This index is used for determining the start and duration of agricultural drought conditions, which arise when soil moisture availability to plants drops to such a level that it adversely affects crop yield, and hence, agricultural production.

The *Soil Moisture Anomaly indicator (SMI)*, that is implemented in the [Copernicus European Drought Observatory (EDO)](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/php/index.php?id=1000), is used for determining the start and duration of agricultural drought conditions, which arise when soil moisture availability to plants drops to such a level that it adversely affects crop yield, and hence, agricultural production. The SMA indicator in EDO is computed every 10-day (dekad) as anomalies of soil moisture index derived from the JRCâ€™s in-house LISFLOOD hydrological model (de Roo et al. 2000), and which has been shown to be effective for drought detection purposes (Laguardia and Niemeyer, 2008).
