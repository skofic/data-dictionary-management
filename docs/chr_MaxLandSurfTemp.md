### chr_MaxLandSurfTemp



------
#### GCU Max Land surface temperature



------
###### Land Surface Temperature (skin temperature) of the GCU during summer month.



------
Remotely sensed *maximum monthly land surface temperature* in *Â°C*. The average of the maximum values of the GCU area is computed for the polygon foot print of GCU boundaries. Beware that for some GCU (i) there are no shapefile available so that the average Land surface temperature over a 5km buffer around the GCU coordinate is taken.
