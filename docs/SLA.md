### SLA



------
#### Specific leaf area



------
###### The ratio between the projected area of a fresh leaf and its dry mass.

SLA is the ratio of investment of dry matter into leaves and the return in terms of area for photosynthesis. The area is projected for broadleaves but accounts for cylindrical geometry for conifer needles.
