#### Risk of desiccation during drought - variance



------
###### Variance of the simulated loss of hydraulic conductance, which represents the risk of mortality



------
Variance of the risk of tree desiccation during drought. Tree desiccation is related to the hydraulic failure which refers to the trees losing their ability to transport water during extreme drought. This phenomenon occurs during extreme drought due to xylem embolism (obstruction by air due to cavitation) and can trigger the complete death of the tree. This index can be only calculated for GCUs where the trees have been measured for hydraulic traits in the field and should be always interpreted together with its mean.  If the variance is small, trees of the target population are experiencing similar desiccation risk and if variance is high, this means that some trees are at high risk of mortality, and some are at no risk.
