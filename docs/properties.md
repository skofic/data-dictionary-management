#### Properties



------
###### Features or properties.



------
This descriptor is generally used to *group* properties or features in a [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org) record. The goal is to *prevent* having *feature properties* at the *top level* of the *record* and, instead, have a *property* that will *only* contain *feature data*.

This is not reserved only to geographic records.
