###### The mean of the dieback index across all measured trees



------
The mean of the values of the dieback index across 10 measured adult dominant or co-dominant trees sampled either inside or in the vicinity of the representative circular plot with a radius of 15 m. The dieback index corresponds to the state of health of the trees determined by assessing foliage loss according to four classes:

- `chr_Dieback_0`: 0% to 25% of defoliation
- `chr_Dieback_1`: 25% to 50% of defoliation
- `chr_Dieback_2`: 50% to 75 % of defoliation
- `chr_Dieback_3`: 75% to 99% of defoliation

The value 100% corresponds to a dead tree.
