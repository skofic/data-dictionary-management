#### Edge predicate



------
###### Edge predicates are used in edges that can be traversed by several paths and that can have several depth levels



------
Predicates are used in two main edge objects: [edges](_edge.md) and [links](_link.md).

[Edges](_edge.md) are used to create *multi-level hierarchical structures* in which a *single edge* may belong to *several graphs* and have *several paths* traverse it.
