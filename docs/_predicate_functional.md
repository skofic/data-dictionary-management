###### Edge predicate that defines the function of the edge relationship



------
Edges have three types of predicates: *functional*, *container* and *bridge*.

*Functional predicates* define the *main function* implemented by the *graph*. An [enumeration predicate](_predicate_enum-of.md), for instance, indicates that the graph contains a controlled vocabulary and that the functional elements in the graph, the nodes connected with the [enumeration predicate](_predicate_enum-of.md), are *valid choices* of the *controlled vocabulary*.
