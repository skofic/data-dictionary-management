### chr_trend_AvNormDiffVegIdx



------
#### Trend (temporal dynamics) in annual mean of GCU averaged NDVI



------
###### Temporal trends of the annual mean remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index.



------
Slope of the relationship between yearly mean remotely sensed NDVI over the GCU and time (NDVI/year).

Beware that for some GCUs there are no shapefile available so that the average Land surface temperature over a 5 km buffer around the GCU coordinate is taken.
