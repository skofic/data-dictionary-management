#### Trunk circumference variance



------
###### Variance of the trunk circumference measured at breast height in a representative circular plot within the GCU (only for trees of circumference > 23.6 cm)



------
The variance of the values of trunk circumference measured at breast height (1.3 m) for all individual trees measured in a circular plot of 15 m radius, representative for the entire GCU. Only trees with circumference > 23.6 cm (DBH > 7.5 cm) are measured.
