Effective population size (Ne) defines the size of an ideal population that would result in the same level of inbreeding or genetic drift as that of the population under study or, in a simpler manner, it can be viewed as the number of individuals in a population who equally contribute offspring to the next generation. Ne is so important in conservation genetics because it quantifies the rate at which a population loses genetic variation, therefore, such measure is used for evaluating the state and viability of populations, both in the short and long period.
