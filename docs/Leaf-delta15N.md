### Leaf-delta15N



------
#### Leaf delta 15N



------
###### The isotopic ratio of 15N to the more abundant 14N nitrogen atoms relative to a standard reference material in per mils in leaf samples.



------
Leaf delta15N is obtained by mass spectrometry of dried and ground leaf samples. Being relative to a standard reference material, it is always negative.
