###### Monthly average of the Leaf Area Index



------
Monthly average value of the leaf area index (LAI) for the whole GCU, giving an idea of the seasonal dynamics of the vegetation. The LAI is an indicator of leaf area (one side) relative to the soil surface. I.e., a LAI of 2 represents a leaf area of 2 m2 for 1 m2 of soil. This gives an overview of the density of the plant cover and therefore the extent of energy and gas exchange between the plant and its environment. The data come from the reflectance of the top of the canopy measured with satellite data at 0.5km resolution (from MODIS).
