#### Wind speed

###### Wind speed in meters per second.



------
It is the *horizontal speed* of *air* at a height of *ten meters* above the surface of the Earth, in *meters per second*. The value is the *combination* of the *Eastward* and *Northward* components of the 10m wind.

Care should be taken when comparing this variable with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.
