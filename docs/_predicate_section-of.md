This predicate involves the concept of *section*, a section is a *category* or *heading* that *groups* a *set* of *choices*. For instance, while the [enumeration](_predicate_enum-of) or [property](_predicate_property-of) predicates indicate that the source node is either a valid *controlled vocabulary choice*, or a *descriptor* belonging to the *destination* node, this predicate would indicate that the source node is to be used as a *container* or *disclosure list*. This predicate is used to *group* controlled vocabulary elements or sets of schema descriptors into sections that will be presented as disclosute lists in the user interface when showing forms or lists.
