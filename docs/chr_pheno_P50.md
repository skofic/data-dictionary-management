#### Xylem vulnerability to embolism



------
###### The water potential at which 50% of the xylem conductivity is lost.



------
Vulnerability to embolism is an index of drought resistance and it is measured using a rotary instrument called cavitron. Tree level data.

This tree level property can also be averaged across trees to provide an equivalent GCU-level estimate (with associated variance).
