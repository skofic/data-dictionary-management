#### Combined Drought Indicator (CDI).

###### The Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) is used to detect and monitor areas that either are affected by or are at risk of agricultural drought.



------
The *Combined Drought Indicator (CDI)*, that is implemented in the [Copernicus European Drought Observatory (EDO)](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/php/index.php?id=1000), is used for drought early warning, specifically designed to monitor agricultural drought. Through the combination of spatial patterns of precipitation, soil moisture and greenness vegetation anomalies, the CDI identifies areas at risk of agricultural drought, areas where the vegetation has already been affected by drought and areas in the process of recovery to normal conditions. Accordingly, the [CDI classification scheme](https://jeodpp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ftp/jrc-opendata/DROUGHTOBS/Drought_Observatories_datasets/factsheets/factsheet_combinedDroughtIndicator_v3.pdf) defines three primary drought classes (*Watch*, *Warning* and *Alert*) and three recovery classes (*Temporary Soil Moisture recovery*, *Temporary vegetation recovery* and *Recovery*).
