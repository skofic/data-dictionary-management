This [predicate](_predicate.md) can be used to create graphs that can be used in *user interfaces* as *forms* or *tables of content*. The *field-of* predicate indicates that the [source](_from.md) node is a *field of*, or an *element* of the [object](_to.md) node. This denomination is *general*, it *does not* indicate a *precise function* such as [enumeration](_predicate_enum-of.md) or [property](_predicate_property-of.md), it indicates a *membership* that is *general* in nature.
