###### Abundance of natural regeneration for the target species of the GCU assessed around all measured trees



------
Abundance of *natural regeneration* assessed around *10 trees* *inside* or *around* the *circular plot* with a *radius of 15 m.*, which is representative of the GCU, where `chr_NaturalRegeneration_0` means *absence of natural regeneration*, `chr_NaturalRegeneration_1` means *scattered regeneration*, `chr_NaturalRegeneration_2` *regeneration in groups* and `chr_NaturalRegeneration_3` *abundant regeneration*.
