Rooting depth is the depth beyond which there are no roots inside the auger or inside the pit. Rooting depth was generally measured by extracting soil samples down to 1 m depth from five cores taken with a soil auger inside the circular plot with a radius of 15 m, which is representative for the GCU. However, in situations when soil petrosity was very high and using the auger proved impossible, a pit was dug.
