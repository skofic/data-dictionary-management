###### Land cover classification with 2 thematic classes (Broadleaved / Coniferous).



------
The [Copernicus DLT](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/high-resolution-layers/forests/dominant-leaf-type/status-maps/dominant-leaf-type-2018?tab=mapview) raster product provides a basic land cover classification with 3 thematic classes (All *non-tree covered areas* / *Broadleaved* / *Coniferous*) at 10m spatial resolution and covers the full of EEA39 area. The data refers to the unit polygons and the value is obtained by a mode reducer.

In this dataset we only track *Broadleaved*  and *Coniferous*, *non-tree covered* areas are not tracked.
