#### Hydraulic capacitance

###### The change in branch relative water content RWC per unit change in water potential.



------
When no water is available in the soil, a tree can survive thanks to its stored water (in bark, stem and leaves) until the next rain comes. Using stored water slows down the rate of dehydration in other important organs, such as leaves and meristems. Hydraulic capacitance is an index of drought avoidance. High values indicate high capacity to avoid the severe effects of drought. It is measured by weight loss of an entire branch of standard length under standard conditions in the laboratory. It is measured in the apical branches of each tree.

This tree level property can also be averaged across trees to provide an equivalent GCU-level estimate (with associated variance).
