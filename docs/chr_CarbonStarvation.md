###### The simulated annual risk of mortality due to carbon starvation computed with the Castanea model



------
The risk of mortality due to carbon starvation refers to the risk that trees will experience a lack of carbon reserves due to the multiple abiotic stresses that the trees may be exposed (frost, high temperature, drought)that progressively, year after year, alter the carbon balance of the trees. These processes are represented in the CASTANEA model which simulate photosynthesis, respiration and carbon allocation on a daily basis. The remaining carbon is allocated to reserves and remobilised in non-vegetative periods or during droughts. When the level of carbon storage decreases below a certain treshold a probability of mortality is estimated.
