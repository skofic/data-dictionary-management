#### Risk of carbon starvation



------
###### The simulated cumulative deficit in Non-Structural Carboydrates (NSC) during the year over the past 30 years computed with the Castanea model or the Medfate model.

Risk of carbon starvation relates to the risk for the trees of a given GCU experience a lack of carbon reserves due to the multiple abiotic stress that can the trees can experience (forst, high temperature, drought) and that are repsented in the models used. The CASTANEA and the MedFate models simulates photosynthesis, respiration and carbon allocation on a daily basis. The remaining carbon is allocated to reserves and is remobilized in non-vegetative periods or during drought episodes.
