The simulated cumulative deficit in Non-Structural Carboydrates (NSC) during the year over the past 30 years computed with the Castanea model or the Medfate model. The risk of carbon starvation refers to the risk that trees will experience a lack of carbon reserves due to the multiple abiotic stresses that the trees may be exposed (frost, high temperature, drought) and that are represented in the models used. The CASTANEA and MedFate models simulate photosynthesis, respiration and carbon allocation on a daily basis. The remaining carbon is allocated to reserves and remobilised in non-vegetative periods or during droughts.
