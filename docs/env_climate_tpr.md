###### Accumulated liquid and frozen water that falls to the Earth's surface.



------
Accumulated *liquid* and *frozen* water, including *rain* and *snow*, that *falls* to the *Earth's surface*. It is the *sum* of *large-scale precipitation* (that precipitation which is generated by large-scale weather patterns, such as troughs and cold fronts) and *convective precipitation* (generated by convection which occurs when air at lower levels in the atmosphere is warmer and less dense than the air above, so it rises).

Precipitation variables do not include fog, dew or the precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before it lands at the surface of the Earth. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.

The units of precipitation are depth in meters. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step.
