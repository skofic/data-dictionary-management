#### Basal area plot



------
###### Total basal area of living or dead trees inside the circular plot, per species.



------
Total basal area of trees assessed by a plot inventory of the trunk circumference at breast height [Breast height trunk circumference] inside the circular plot of 15m radius (for all individual trees of circumference > 23.6 cm). This measurement is carried out by distinguishing the dead from the living trees and the different species. So, it's possible to estimate the basal area per species. The plot is placed around the tree having the reading from the Bitterlisch relascope closest to the mean.

Stand level data.
