###### The variance of the ratio of dry mass to fresh volume of a branch wood sample across all measured trees



------
Variance of the values of branch wood density for the apical branches of 10 measured adult dominant or co-dominant trees sampled either inside or in the vicinity of the representative circular plot with a radius of 15 m. Wood density is a measure of mass invested per unit of volume. High density wood is generally correlated with long wood lifespan, high resistance to pathogen attacks and mechanical damage. It also relates inversely to volumetric growth, hence trees with high wood density are said to be resource conservative.
