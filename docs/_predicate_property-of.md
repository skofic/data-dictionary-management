###### The source node is a property of the destination node.



------
This predicate is used in [object](_type_object) graphs. When two nodes are related with this predicate, it means that the *source* node is a *property* of the *destination* node. This means that the source node should be considered a *property* of the *data structure* defined by the *destination* node. This also implies that the source node represents a *descriptor*.
