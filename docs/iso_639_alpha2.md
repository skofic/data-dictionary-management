DESCRIPTION

------

*Alpha-2* codes (for codes composed of 2 letters of the [ISO basic Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet "ISO basic Latin alphabet")) are used in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1 "ISO 639-1"). When codes for a wider range of languages were desired, more than 2 letter combinations could cover (a maximum of 262 = 676), [ISO 639-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-2 "ISO 639-2") was developed using Alpha-3 codes.
