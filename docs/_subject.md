### _subject



------
#### Trait subject



------
###### Subject to which the trait refers to.



------
The category should indicate to which *subject* the *trait* applies to and not to what the *measurement refers* to. For instance in *plant height*, the subject is the *plant*, although the *value* of the *trait* may refer to a *population*.
