#### Xylem vulnerability to embolism mean



------
###### The mean of the water potential at which 50% of the xylem capacity to conduct water to the leaves is lost across all measured trees



------
The mean of the values of xylem vulnerability to embolism for the apical branches of 10 measured adult dominant/co-dominant trees sampled either inside or in the vicinity of a representative circular plot with a 15 m radius. When a tree is droughted, its xylem is vulnerable to losing its capacity to conduct water to the leaves, i.e., its hydraulic conductivity, because of the formation of air emboli inside the xylem conduits.
