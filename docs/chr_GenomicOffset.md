### chr_GenomicOffset



------
#### Genomic offset



------
###### The distance between the current and predicted optimal genomic composition in a set of putatively adaptive loci under a future/changed environment. A measure of the mismatch in genotype-climate association between current and potential future climates.



------
Genomic offset is related to population vulnerability to new environmental conditions. However it does not account for adaptation capacity of populations, and is therefore appropriate to assess short-term vulnerability only (valid only if the correlation between allele frequencies and environment does not change).
