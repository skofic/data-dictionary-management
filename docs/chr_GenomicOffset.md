###### A population measure of maladaptation under future environmental conditions



------
Genomic offset measures population vulnerability to new environmental conditions. It refers to the expected change in allele frequencies that would be required to mantain optimal fitness under future conditions (e.g. changing climate). It assumes equilibrium between current conditions and allele frequencies and it is usually calculated based on a set of genetic markers under natural selection. It is sensitive to the environmental variables used in the analysis. Reference: Capblancq, T., Fitzpatrick, M. C., Bay, R. A., Exposito-Alonso, M., & Keller, S. R. (2020).
