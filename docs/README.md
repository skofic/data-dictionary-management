# Data dictionary

This tool was developed to allow documenting and curating data sets by storing data definitions in a structure that allows validating the data and providing thorough information to anyone interested in making use of the data.

The dictionary does not store the data itself, it stores the documentation and constraints for each data variable, so that variables have a unique identifier and have a set of documentation fields which can provide all the necessary information to understand *what* the data is, *how* the data can be used, which are the *constraints* the data must follow in order to be valid and any other information that may be useful to both those who use the data and those may be interested in using it.

This tool implements a system in which you define terms of different type which are related to each other in a graph. We use [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com) as the database to implement the system and [Foxx](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/foxx.html) micro services to provide the API.

## Structure

The main object that constitutes the "Lego" pieces in the system is the [term](_term.md). A term is a document that will be stored in the database, which contains properties that define its function. All terms are stored in the terms collection.

### Terms

[Terms](_term.md) are concepts that, depending on what properties they hold and depending on how they are related to each other, have different functions and meanings. This is similar to language, in which certain words may change their meaning depending on their position in a sentence.

Terms come in different types:

- [Plain terms](_term.md): a plain term could be a namespace, represent an enumeration, or an element of a controlled vocabulary.
- [Descriptor](_term_descriptor.md): a descriptor is a term that documents a variable which contains data of a specific type.
- [Structure](_term_object.md): a term that represents a data structure definition.

What makes a term belong to one or another class is a combination of how the term is related to other terms, and if it contains specific properties that define a particular behaviour.

#### Identification section (`_code`)

All terms require this [property](_code.md), which is a data structure that contains a series of fields used to identify the term, no term may omit this section. These are the fields that make up the section:

- [Namespace](_nid.md) (`_nid`): The *namespace* is used to group other terms under a common nomenclature. This makes the naming of terms easier, when their number grows. Also it allows several terms to share the same code without conflicting. This field's content is a [reference](gid.md) to another term that takes the namespace function. This field os not required, but once it has been set or omitted, it cannot be changed.
- [Local identifier](_lid.md) (`_lid`): The *local identifier* is a code, assigned to the term, which must be unique within its namespace. This code becomes the identifier of the term within the group defined by the namespace. This field is required and once set, it cannot be modified.
- [Global identifier](_gid.md) (`_gid`): The *global identifier* uniquely identifies the term in all [namespaces](_nid.md), it is the *unique identifier* of the *term*. This field is not assigned, it is computed  by the concatenating the [namespace](_nid.md) with the [local identifier](_lid.md) separated by an underscore (`_`) token. In the current implementation, this value is copied to the [document key](_key). *In the dictionary, the global identifier of a descriptor term is used as the property name*. This field is required and immutable.
- [Other identifiers](_aid.md) (`_aid`): This field records all *official* or *agreed* upon codes that *identify* the term. This allows tracking the different identifiers that a term may be referred to. These codes are at the same level as the [local identifier](_lid.md). This field is required, because it must contain by default the [local identifier](_lid.md).
- [Provider identifiers](_pid.md) (`_pid`): This field records the *identifiers* assigned to the *term* by the *data providers*. This becomes useful when submitting or receiving datasets. This field is optional.
- [Original name](_name.md) (`_name`): This field records the local name or original denomination, if this makes sense. This field is optional.

All terms must feature this section which represents the identification data of the term.

```json
{
	"_code": {
		"_lid": "iso",
		"_gid": "iso",
		"_aid": ["iso"]
	}
}
```

Above is an example of a term representing the [International Standards Organisation (ISO)](https://www.iso.org/home.html) namespace. As you can see, it is a *top level namespace*, since it does not include the [namespace field](_nid.md) (**`_nid`**), so its [global identifier](_gid.md) (**`_gid`**) is the same as its [local identifier](_lid.md) (**`_lid`**), `iso`.

```json
{
	"_code": {
		"_nid": "iso",
		"_lid": "3166",
		"_gid": "iso_3166",
		"_aid": ["3166"]
	}
}
```

Above is an example of a term representing the [ISO 3166 - Country Codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) standard. This term features `iso` in its [namespace field](_nid.md) (**`_nid`**), so this term belongs to the *ISO* namespace. In this case the `3166` code has a meaning only in the *ISO* context. This is an example of a two level namespace.

```json
{
	"_code": {
		"_nid": "iso_3166",
		"_lid": "1",
		"_gid": "iso_3166_1",
		"_aid": ["1"]
	}
}
```

Above is an example of a term representing the [ISO 3166-1 - (Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions â€” Part 1: Country code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) standard. This term features `iso_3166` in its [namespace field](_nid.md) (**`_nid`**), so this term belongs to the *ISO 3166 - Country Codes* namespace. In this case the `1` code has a meaning only in the *ISO 3166 - Country Codes* context. This is an example of a three level namespace.

```json
{
	"_code": {
		"_nid": "iso_3166_1",
		"_lid": "ITA",
		"_gid": "iso_3166_1_ITA",
		"_aid": ["IT", "ITA"],
		"_pid": ["I"],
		"_name": "Repubblica Italiana"
	}
}
```

Above is an example of a term representing the *ISO 3166-1* code for the country *Italy*.

- [Namespace](_nid.md) (**`_nid`**): The *namespace* is the [global identifier](_gid.md) (**`_gid`**) of the term that represents *ISO 3166-1 Country Codes* standard.
- [Local identifier](_lid.md) (**`_lid`**): The *local identifier* is the country code for *Italy* in the *ISO 3166-1* standard referenced by the [namespace](_nid.md) field (**`_nid`**). No other term belonging to the same namespace may share the same local identifier.
- [Global identifier](_gid.md) (**`_gid`**): The *global identifier* is the *unique identifier* of this *term*, no other term can have this code.
- [Other identifiers](_aid.md) (**`_aid`**): Besides the official `ITA` code, Italy can be identified also with the `IT` code. This field is *useful* when trying to *resolve controlled vocabulary elements* with *data* that *does not follow* strictly the *implemented standards*.
- [Provider identifiers](_pid.md) (**`_pid`**): The *data provider* follows a *different standard* than ours, the code used for *Italy* is `I`. This field can be useful when decoding incoming data which is not yet normalised.
- [Name](_name) (**`_name`**): This field is *relevant* only in *certain cases*, here we store the *official country name* in the *native language* of the *country*, `Repubblica Italiana`.

The identification section is where you have all the necessary information to identify a specific term.

#### Documentation section (`_info`)

While the previous section is mainly used by computers to lookup terms, [this section](_info.md) is mainly used by humans to understand what the term represents and how it can be used.

This property holds an [object data structure](_type_object.md) in which all fields are [key/value dictionaries](_dict.md) where the *key* represents the *language* and the *value* is human readable [text](_type_string.md). These fields should be used to provide, in *several languages*, all the *necessary documentation* to *understand* what the term represents, how the *data* described by the term can be *used*, *why* do we use that data and any other *additional information* that a person, which is not an expert in the subject matter, can use and *take advantage* of the *data* associated with the *term*.

- [Title](_title.md) (`_title`): You can think of the *title* as a *name* or *label*. When presenting an *input form*, the *title* of a [descriptor term](_term_descriptor.md) could be used as the *label* of the *input field*. The text in this [field](_title.md) should be as short as possible and expected to be presented in a relevant context. The value part of the dictionary should contain *plain text*. This property should always be included.
- [Definition](_definition.md) (`_definition`): This field should *contain* an *explanation* that must provide *enough information*, to a person *familiar with the subject matter*, to *understand* and *make use* of the term data. The value part of the dictionary should contain *plain text*. This property is *optional* only if beyond the [title](_title.md) (`_title`), there is *no other relevant information*. It is understood that if you *omit* this field, the only *other fields* that should be included in the section are the [examples](_examples.md) (`_notes`) and [notes](_notes.md) (`_notes`) fields.
- [Description](_description.md) (`_description`): This field should contain *all the information* needed by someone, not expert in the subject matter, to *understand* the *term data*, understand *why* such data is *useful*, understand *how* to *make use of it* and provide *thorough indormation* on *related topics*. The value part of the dictionary should contain [text](_type_text.md) encoded in the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) [format](_format_markdown.md), this to be able to present a lot of information in an *understandable* and *structured* manner. This field should only be omitted if all the neccessary information was already provided in the [title](_title.md) (`_title`) and [definition](_definition.md) (`_definition`) fields.
- [Examples](_examples.md) (`_examples`): In some cases, it may be useful to *provide examples* of *usage* or *input*: this field should be used to help users make *correct use* of the term. There are instances in which it becomes much easier to explain something by showing an example, use this field if that is the case. The value part of the dictionary should contain [text](_type_text.md) encoded in the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) [format](_format_markdown.md).
- [Notes](_notes.md) (`_notes`): This field can be used to add notes and comments to this section. The information provided should not represent actual documentation, but mostly related facts and user opinions.The value part of the dictionary should contain [text](_type_text.md) encoded in the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) [format](_format_markdown.md).

Here is an example of this section:

```json
{
	"_info": {
		"_title": {
			"iso_639_3_eng": "Elevation",
			"iso_639_3_ita": "Elevazione"
		},
		"_definition": {
			"iso_639_3_eng": "Altitude starting from sea level.",
			"iso_639_3_ita": "Altitudine a partire dal livello del mare."
		},
		"_description": {
			"iso_639_3_eng": "Used in climatic and geographic datasets.",
			"iso_639_3_ita": "Utilizzato nei dati climatici e geografici."
		},
		"_examples": {
			"iso_639_3_eng": "0: sea level; 1500: location.",
			"iso_639_3_ita": "0: livello del mare; 1500: posizione."
		},
		"_notes": {
			"iso_639_3_eng": "Values must be expressed in meters.",
			"iso_639_3_ita": "I valori devono essere espressi in metri."
		}
	}
}
```

Obviously the documentation provided in the example is short for formatting reasons, in practice you should record as much information as possible to make this useful.

This section is *required*: all terms should provide *documentation readable by humans* that *explains* what the term represents. There is only one case where it is allowed to omit this section and that is when a controlled vocabulary element has a different preferred choice, which means that all the documentation is already hosted by the term that is the preferred choice. We shall explain this mechanism when we will talk about [edges](_edge.md) and [bridge](_predicate_bridge-of.md) [predicates](_predicate.md).

#### Data section (`_data`)

While all terms must include the [identification](_code.md) and [documentation](_info.md) sections, [this section](_data.md) is *required* by terms that represent [descriptors](_term_descriptor.md). Descriptors are *data definitions*, these terms should provide everything that is necessary to describe the descriptor's data, understand what the data is and all the other information that relates directly to the data, its format and allow the data dictionary to *validate* incoming data. Descriptors are the core of the data dictionary, all other types of terms provide a service and ancillary data to descriptors.

This section is an object structure property that expects *one field* which defines the *data container*.

- [Scalar container](_scalar.md) (`_scalar`): A scalar value is a single value, such as a *number*, *text* or *object*. This section will contain the [data type](_type.md) definitions for the scalar part of the value. If *empty* the value may be any *scalar value* ([arrays](_array.md) and [sets](_set.md) excluded).
- [Array container](_array.md) (`_array`): A list of values of any shape. This section must contain *one* or *none* of the following containers: [scalar](_scalar.md) (`_scalar`), [array](_array.md) (`_array`), [_set.md]() (`_set`) or [dictionary](_dict.md) (`_dict`).
- [Set container](_set.md) (`_set`): A list of values which are unique, no two elements may share the same value. This section must contain the [set scalar](_set_scalar.md) (`_scalar`) container section.
- [Dictionary container](_dict.md) (`_dict`): A key/value dictionary. While it is technically an *object* structure, *keys* are *dynamic*, so they are *not* considered *descriptors*.

Only *one* of the above containers may be included at the level of the [data container](_data.md). It is also possible to *omit* it, leaving the [data container](_data.md) *empty*: in that case the value can be of *any shape* and *type*.

##### Scalar container (`_scalar`)

The leaf element of any data definition is a [scalar](_scalar.md) value. A scalar value is a *data container* that holds a *single* value, not [arrays](_array.md), [sets](_set.md) or [dictionaries](_dict.md).. These are common *types* of *scalar values*:

- A [boolean](_type_boolean.md) value, `true` or `false`.
- An [integer](_type_integer.md) or a [float](_type_number.md) including a [timestamp](_type_number_timestamp.md).
- Text [string](_type_string.md), including a [key reference](_type_string_key-md), [document handle](_type_string_handle.md) and a [controlled vocabulary element](_type_string_enum.md).
- An [object](_type_object.md) data structure, including a [GeoJson object](_type_object_geo-json.md).

The *scalar container definition* is an [object structure](_scalar.md) that holds the following descriptors:

- [Classification](_class.md) (`_class`): An enumeration indicating the data classification.
- [Data type](_type.md) (`_type`): An enumeration indicating the data type of the value, only scalar containers get to define the type.
- [Data kind](_kind.md) (`_kind`): This field is related to the [data type](_type.md) (`_type`) value, the data kind is used to *restrict* [enumerations](_type_enum.md) to a specific *controlled vocabulary* and [objects](_type_object.md) to a specific object *structure definition*.
- [Format](_format.md) (`_format`): This field is an [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md) used to indicate in what format the character data is encoded.
- [Unit](_unit.md) (`_unit`): An [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md) that indicates in what unit the data is represented.
- [Unit name](_unit-name.md) (`_unit-name`): The name of the unit, in case it is not yet part of the [unit](_unit.md) enumeration.
- [Regular expression](_regexp.md) (`_regexp`): A *validation* pattern for [strings](_type_string.md).
- [Range](_range.md) (`_range`): A structure property indicating a generic *range*.
- [Valid range](_valid-range.md) (`_valid-range`): A structure property indicating the *range* within which values are *valid*; values out of range are considered *errors*.
- [Normal range](_normal-range.md) (`_normal-range`): A structure property indicating the *range* within which values are considered *normal*; values out of range are considered *outliers*.

The section *requires* the [data type](_type.md) property, which defines the *type* of the *scalar value*. The section may also be left *empty*, in which case the *value* can be a *scalar* of the above types.

```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_scalar": {
			"_class": "_class_quantity",
			"_type": "_type_integer",
			"_valid-range": {
				"_min-range-inclusive": 5,
				"_max-range-inclusive": 10
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The above example describes a [quantitative](__class_quantity.md) [scalar](_scalar.md) discrete [integer](_type_integer.md) value in the [range](_range.md) from `5` to `10` inclusive.


```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_scalar": {
			"_class": "_class_quantity",
			"_type": "_type_number",
			"_valid-range": {
				"_min-range-inclusive": 0.0,
				"_max-range-exclusive": 100.0
			},
			"_unit": "_unit_length_cm"
		}
	}
}
```

The above example describes a [continuous](_type_number.md) [quantitative](_class_quantity.md) [scalar](_scalar.md) value *greater or equal* to `0.0` and *less than* `100.0` representing a [length](_unit_length.md) in [centimetres](_unit_length_cm.md).


```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_scalar": {
			"_class": "_class_category",
			"_type": "_type_string_enum",
			"_kind": ["iso_639_3"]
		}
	}
}
```

The above example describes a [categorical](_class_category.md) [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md) that must be chosen from the [controlled vocabulary](_type_string_enum.md) of [ISO 639](iso_639_3) *language codes*.


```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_scalar": {
			"_type": "_type_string",
			"_format": "_format_markdown"
		}
	}
}
```

The above example describes a [text](_type_string.md) value *encoded* in [Markdown](_format_markdown.md) format.


```json
{
	"_scalar": {}
}
```

The above example shows the *data definition* for a *descriptor* that can hold *scalar* values of *any type*.

##### Array container (`_array`)

The [array](_array.md) section defines a *container* for a *list* of *values*, the section must contain *one* or *none* of the following data definition sections: the [scalar section](_scalar.md) (`_scalar`), the [array section](_array.md) (`_array`), the [set section](_set.md) (`_set`) or the [dictionary section](_dict.md) (`_dict`). If the section is *empty*, it means that the *value* can be an *array* of *any shape* or *type*.

```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_array": {
			"_scalar": {
				"_class": "_class_quantity",
				"_type": "_type_integer",
				"_valid-range": {
					"_min-range-inclusive": 5,
					"_max-range-inclusive": 10
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The above example describes an *array* of [scalar](_scalar.md) [integer](_type_integer.md) values in the [range](_valid-range.md) from `5` to `10` inclusive, the *list element* values are [quantitatve](_class_quantity.md).

```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_array": {
			"_array": {
				"_scalar": {
					"_class": "_class_quantity",
					"_type": "_type_number",
					"_valid-range": {
						"_min-range-inclusive": 0.0,
						"_max-range-exclusive": 100.0
					},
					"_unit": "_unit_length_cm"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The above example describes a [list](_array.md) of [number](_type_number.md) [arrays](_array.md) whose values must be *greater than or equal* to `0.0` and *less than* `100.0` representing [lengths](_unit_length.md) in [centimetres](_unit_length_cm.md), the *elements* of the *inner list* are [quantitatve](_class_quantity.md).

```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_array": {
			"_set": {
				"_scalar": {
					"_class": "_class_category",
					"_type": "_type_string_enum",
					"_kind": ["iso_639_3"]
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The above example describes an [array](_array.md) of [sets](_set.md) whose *elements* belong to the [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md) of ISO 639 [language codes](iso_639_3.md), the *elements* of the *inner set* are [categorical](_class_category.md).

```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_array": {
			"_dict": {
				"_dict_key": {
					"_class": "_class_category",
					"_type_key": "_type_string_enum",
					"_kind": ["iso_3166_1"]
				},
				"_dict_value": {
					"_scalar": {
						"_type": "_type_object",
						"_kind": ["my_struct_definition"]
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The above example describes an [array](_array.md) of [key/value dictionary](_dict.md) *items*. The [dictionary keys](_dict_key.md) are [categorical](_class_category.md) and must be selected among the elements of the [ISO country codes](iso_3166_1.md) [controlled vocabulary](_type_string_enum.md). The dictionary values are [objects](_type_object.md) of the `my_struct_definition` class.

```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_array": {}
	}
}
```

The above example describes an [array](_array.md) that can have *elements* of *any shape* or *type*.

##### Set container (`_set`)

The [set](_set.md) section defines a *container* for a *list* of *unique values*, which means that no two values in the list must be the same. This section must contain the [scalar set section](_set_scalar.md) (`_set_scalar`), this section cannot be left empty.

Given that the elements of the set must implement equality, the type of data that sets can hold is limited to:

- [Boolean](_type_boolean.md) values, `true` or `false`.
- [Integers](_type_integer.md) or [floats](_type_number.md) including [timestamps](_type_number_timestamp.md).
- Text [strings](_type_string.md), including [key references](_type_string_key-md), [document handles](_type_string_handle.md) and a [controlled vocabulary elements](_type_string_enum.md).

```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_set": {
			"_set_scalar": {
				"_set_type": "_type_boolean"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

This example describes a *set* of [booleans](_type_boolean.md); such a *set* can *only* contain *one* element, `true` or `false`.


```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_set": {
			"_set_scalar": {
				"_class": "_class_quantity",
				"_set_type": "_type_integer"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

This example describes a *set* of [discrete](_type_integer.md) [quantitative](_class_quantity.md) values.


```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_set": {
			"_set_scalar": {
				"_class": "_class_quantity",
				"_set_type": "_type_number",
				"_valid-range": {
					"_min-range-inclusive": 0.0,
					"_max-range-exclusive": 100.0
				},
				"_unit": "_unit_length_cm"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

This example describes a *set* of [continuous](_type_number.md) [quantitative](_class_quantity.md) values *greater or equal* to `0.0` and *less than* `100.0` representing [centimetres](_unit_length_cm.md).


```json
{
	"_data": {
		"_set": {
			"_set_scalar": {
				"_class": "_class_category",
				"_set_type": "_type_string_enum",
				"_kind": ["iso_639_3"]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

This example describes a set of [categorical](_class_category.md) [enumerations](_type_string_enum.md) that must be chosen from the [controlled vocabulary](_type_string_enum.md) of [ISO 639](iso_639_3.md) *language codes*.

###### Set scalar container (`_set_scalar`)

A set can only contain scalar elements, for this reason the type of value must be known: this means that the scalar container must contain the [set scalar container](_set_scalar.md) definition (`_set_scalar`). This container definition is similar to the [scalar](_scalar.md) container, but it includes a smaller selection of properties:

- [Classification](_class.md) (`_class`): An enumeration indicating the data classification.
- [Data type](_set_type.md) (`_set_type`): An enumeration indicating the data type of the value. Note that this property is similar to the scalar container data type, but it does not include the [object](_type_object.md) and [_type_object_geo-json.md]() data types.
- [Data kind](_kind.md) (`_kind`): This field is related to the [data type](_set_type.md) (`_set_type`) value, the data kind is used to *restrict* [enumerations](_type_enum.md) to a specific *controlled vocabulary*.
- [Format](_format.md) (`_format`): This field is an [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md) used to indicate in what format the character data is encoded.
- [Unit](_unit.md) (`_unit`): An [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md) that indicates in what unit the data is represented.
- [Unit name](_unit-name.md) (`_unit-name`): The name of the unit, in case it is not yet part of the [unit](_unit.md) enumeration.
- [Regular expression](_regexp.md) (`_regexp`): A *validation* pattern for [strings](_type_string.md).
- [Range](_range.md) (`_range`): A structure property indicating a generic *range*.
- [Valid range](_valid-range.md) (`_valid-range`): A structure property indicating the *range* within which values are *valid*; values out of range are considered *errors*.
- [Normal range](_normal-range.md) (`_normal-range`): A structure property indicating the *range* within which values are considered *normal*; values out of range are considered *outliers*.

##### Dictionary container (`_dict`)

A [dictionary](_dict.md) is technically an object, except that its property names are dynamic, which makes them keys, rather than descriptors.

When validating dictionaries, the *key* and the *value* are handled separately, the *keys* are defined in the [dictionary key container](_dict_key.md) and are *not matched* to *descriptors*, the *values* are defined in the [dictionary value container](_dict_value.md).

This container section *expects both* of the following properties:

- [Dictionary key definition](_dict_key.md) (`_dict_key`): This section defines the type of dictionary keys, which are by definition [strings](_type_string.md), including [document keys](_type_string_key.md) and [enumerations](_type_string_enum.md). This section is similar to the [scalar container definition](_scalar.md), and it features the following properties:

    - [Classification](_class.md) (`_class`): An enumeration indicating the data classification.
    - [Data type](_type_key.ms) (`_type_key`): An enumeration indicating the data type of the value. Note that this property is similar to the scalar container data type, but it does not include the [boolean](_type_boolean.md), [integer](_type_integer.md), [number](_type_number.md), [document handle](_type_string_handle.md), [object](_type_object.md) and [GeoJson](_type_object_geo-json.md) data types.
    - [Data kind](_kind.md) (`_kind`): This field is related to the [data type](_type_key.md) (`_type_key`) value, the data kind is used to *restrict* [enumerations](_type_enum.md) to a specific *controlled vocabulary*.
    - [Format](_format.md) (`_format`): This field is an [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md) used to indicate in what format the character data is encoded.
    - [Unit](_unit.md) (`_unit`): An [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md) that indicates in what unit the data is represented.
    - [Unit name](_unit-name.md) (`_unit-name`): The name of the unit, in case it is not yet part of the [unit](_unit.md) enumeration.
    - [Regular expression](_regexp.md) (`_regexp`): A *validation* pattern for [strings](_type_string.md).

- [Dictionary data definition](_dict_value.md) (`_dict_value`): This section defines the *shape* and *type* of the data that constitutes the *value* part of the dictionary key/value pair. This container section expects the same elements as the [data section definition](_data.md):

    - [Scalar container](_scalar.md) (`_scalar`): Scalar data type definition.

    - [Array container](_array.md) (`_array`):Array container definition.

    - [Set container](_set.md) (`_set`): Set container definition.

    - [Dictionary container](_dict.md) (`_dict`): Key/value dictionary definition.


The [key definition]() (`dict_key`) may be left *empty*, in that case keys are expected to be plain [strings](_type_string.md). The [value definition](_dict_value.md) (`_dict_value`) can also be left *empty*, in that case the value can take any shape or type. Finally, the [dictionary container section](_dict.md) (`_dict`) can also be left empty, in which case keys are expected to be plain strings and values anything.

#### Data structure section (`_rule`)

[This section](_rule.md) is *required* by terms that represent [object definitions](_term_object.md). You define object data by creating a [descriptor term](_term_descriptor.md) with a [data type](_type.md) of [object](_type_object.md) (`_type_object`). This only tells the dictionary that the descriptor is an [object](_type_object.md), but the properties it contains and which ones are required is not known: this is why we have the [data kind](_kind.md) property in which we can set the [object definition term](_term_object.md) that contains these rules.

The [term](_term_object.md) that contains this [section](_rule.md) is the root of a tree graph in which are connected all the [descriptor terms](_term_descriptor.md) that represent the properties that belong to that term. This tells us which are the properties that belong to that object definition. This [section](_rule.md) contains fields that can be used to define which properties are required, which should not be included and other information, the section has the following fields:

- [Required properties](_required.md) (`_required`): This section can be used to indicate which properties are required by the object, if this rule is not satisfied, this means that the object is invalid. The section can contain the following fields:
    - [One of](_selection-descriptors_one.md) (`_selection-descriptors_one`): should contain *one* descriptor from the set.
    - [One or none](_selection-descriptors_one-none.md) (`_selection-descriptors_one-none`): should contain *one* descriptor from the set or *none*.
    - [Any of](_selection-descriptors_any.md) (`_selection-descriptors_any`): should contain *one* or *more* descriptors from the set.
    - [Any one in](_selection-descriptors_any-one.md) (`_selection-descriptors_any-one`): should include *one* or *no* element from *each list* of sets, the result should have at *least one* element.
    - [All of](_selection-descriptors_all.md) (`_selection-descriptors_all`): should contain *all* descriptors from the set.
- [Recommended properties](_recommended.md) (`_recommended`): This section can be used to indicate properties that are recommended to be included in the object, but that are not necessarily required. This section contains the same fields as the [required properties section](_required.md)(`_required`).
- [Banned properties](_banned.md) (`_banned`): This field is a [set](_set.md) of [descriptor](_term_descriptor.md) [global identifiers](_gid.md) listing which properties *should not* be *included* in the object.
- [Computed properties](_computed.md) (`_computed`): This field is a set of [descriptor](_term_descriptor.md) [global identifiers](_gid.md) listing which properties are *computed*, meaning that their content is automatically calculated.

- [Locked properties](_locked.md) (`_locked`): This field is a set of [descriptor](_term_descriptor.md) [global identifiers](_gid.md) listing which properties are *locked*, meaning that their content *cannot* be *modified*, but they can be *deleted*. This applies also to nested properties.
- [Immutable properties](_immutable.md) (`_immutable`): This field is a set of [descriptor](_term_descriptor.md) [global identifiers](_gid.md) listing which properties are *immutable*, meaning that their content *cannot* be *modified* and they *cannot* be *deleted*. This applies also to nested properties.
- [Default values](_default-value.md) (`_default-value`): This is an [object](_type_object.md) whose properties correspond to properties in the object, and the values represent the default values. Before storing the document, if the object does not have already any of the properties in the default values object, these will be added along with their default value.

Any [term](_term_object.md) that features this [section](_rule.md) can be used as a value of the [data kind](_kind.md) for values of [type](_type.md) [object](_type_object.md).

```json
{
	"_rule": {
		"_required": {
			"_selection-descriptors_one": ["one", "two", "three"],
			"_selection-descriptors_any": ["red", "green", "blue"],
			"_selection-descriptors_all": ["mon", "tue", "wed"]
		},
		"_recommended": {
			"_selection-descriptors_any": ["thu", "fri"]
		},
		"_banned": ["sat", "sun"],
		"_computed": ["_key"],
		"_locked": ["lock"],
		"_immutable": ["_key"],
		"_default-value": {
			"one": 1,
			"two": 2,
			"three": [1, 2, 3],
			"red": "It is red"
		}
	}
}
```

[Objects](_type_object.md) whose [data kind](_kind.md) features this [rule section](_rule.md) should satisfy the following conditions:

- It must contain one of the following descriptors: `one`, `two` or `three`
- It must contain one or more of the following descriptors: `red`, `green` or `blue`.
- It must contain all of the following descriptors: `mon`, `tue` and `wed`.
- It is recommended to contain one or more of the following descriptors: `thu` and/or `fri`.
- It must not contain the following descriptors: `sat` and `sun`.
- The `_key` descriptor is computed.
- The `lock` descriptor is locked: it cannot be modified, but it can be deleted.
- The `_key` descriptor's value is immutable: it cannot be modified or deleted.
- If omitted, the following descriptors will be added to the object along with the following default values:
    - `one`: `1`
    - `two`: `2`
    - `three`: `[1, 2, 3]`
    - `red`: `"It is red"`

### Edges

Terms are used to define descriptors, object definitions, types and enumerations, they do so by providing properties that indicate the rules that must be satisfied so that the entity defined by the term can behave correctly. However, that is only one part of the picture: terms are related to each other forming graphs that represent controlled vocabularies, data structure property dependencies and any other relationship of the form **subject** => **predicate** => **object**.

[Edges](_edge.md) are documents, from the *edges* collection, that contain a [reference](_type_string_handle.md) to the [subject](_from.md) node, a [predicate](_predicate.md) that indicates the *type* of *relationship*, and a [reference](_type_string_handle.md) to the [object](_to.md) node.

![](/Users/milko/Local/Development/Projects/EUFGIS/data-dictionary-management/docs/subject-Predicate-Object.png)

In the above simple example, `A` is the [subject](_from.md), `Belongs to` is the [predicate](_predicate.md) and `B` is the [object](_to.md). No two edges can share the same combination, this means that there can only be one edge connecting two terms, in the same direction, with the same predicate. Using this mechanism we can create large graphs that can describe the structure of many objects used in the data dictionary.

An edge must contain the following properties:

- [Subject](_from.md) (`_from`): The [source node](_from.md) of the relationship, it is the subject of the verb defined by the [predicate](_predicate.md). The value of this field is the [handle](_type_string_handle.md) of the document representing the [subjet node](_from.md).
- [Predicate](_predicate.md) (`_predicate`): The predicate defines the type and nature of the relationship, it describes how the two nodes are related. The value of this field is the [global identifier](_gid.md) of the [predicates](_predicate.md) [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md), which currently has the following values:
    - [Enumeration of](_predicate_enum-of.md) (`_predicate_enum-of`): The [source](_from.md) (`_from`) term is an [enumerated](_type_string_enum.md) element of the [destination](_to.md) (`_to`) term. This means that the [source term](_from.md) is a valid choice in the [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md) defined by the [destination term](_to.md).
    - [Property of](_predicate_property-of.md) (`_predicate_property-of`): The [source](_from.md) (`_from`) descriptor is a property belonging to the [destination](_to.md) (`_to`) term. This means that the [source term](_from.md) is a property belonging to the [object structure](_type_object.md) defined by the [destination term](_to.md).
    - [Section of](_predicate_section-of.md) (`_predicate_section-of`): The [source](_from.md) (`_from`) node is a *section*, *category* or *group* of the [destination](_to.md) (`_to`) node. Such relationships are used to group elements under a common parent that will not be an active member of the graph.
    - [Bridge of](_predicate_bridge-of.md) (`_predicate_bridge-of`): The [destination](_to.md) (`_to`) node will use the graph of the [source](_from.md) node *without including* the *source node* in its own graph.
- [Object](_to.md) (`_to`): The [destination node](_to.md) of the relationship, it is the object of the verb defined by the [predicate](_predicate.md). The value of this field is the [handle](_type_string_handle.md) of the document representing the [object node](_to.md).
- [Path](_path.md) (`_path`): This field is a [set](_set.md) of [document handles](_type_string_handle.md) listing all the branches that make use of that specific [edge](_edge.md). This property allows different graphs to share the same edge and not lose their path. The values represent all root nodes whose graphs cross this [edge](edge.md).

The [document key](_key.md) of [edges](_edge.md) is computed by concatenating the [source node](_from.md), the [predicate](_predicate.md) and the [destination node](_to.md), separated by the slash (`/`) token, in an MD5 hash. This ensures that no two edges share the same relationship. The [path](_path.md) property makes it possible to have several graph branches use the same edge, and a side effect of this is that all the edges of a specific graph will have the reference to the root node in the elements of the [path](_path) property.

Graphs are used in the dictionary to implement [controlled vocabularies](_type_string_enum.md):

![GraphSimpleEnum](/Users/milko/Local/Development/Projects/EUFGIS/data-dictionary-management/docs/GraphSimpleEnum.png)

In the above example we have an [enumeration](_type_string_enum.md) called *COUNTRIES* that has two elements: *ITALY* and *FRANCE*. This results in two edges:

```json
[
	{
		"_from": "terms/ITALY",
		"_predicate": "_predicate_enum-of",
		"_to": "terms/COUNTRIES",
		"_path": ["terms/COUNTRIES"]
	},
	
	{
		"_from": "terms/FRANCE",
		"_predicate": "_predicate_enum-of",
		"_to": "terms/COUNTRIES",
		"_path": ["terms/COUNTRIES"]
	}
]
```

ITALY and FRANCE are two valid elements of the COUNTRIES enumeration.

Enumerations may contain a hierarchy, meaning that an element may contain other elements, and both the container and the contained elements are valid choices:

![GraphEnumHierarchic](/Users/milko/Local/Development/Projects/EUFGIS/data-dictionary-management/docs/GraphEnumHierarchic.png)

In the above example we have a LOCATION enumeration in which both EUROPE and ASIA are valid elements, you may select FRANCE as a location, but also ASIA, and at the same time EUROPE and ASIA act as groups for the respective countries.

Suppose that we have a lot of countries and we want to group them under [sections](_predicate_section-of.md):

![](/Users/milko/Local/Development/Projects/EUFGIS/data-dictionary-management/docs/GraphEnumSection.png)

Here we have two sections, EUROPE and ASIA: each country belongs to its section, but ASIA and EUROPE are not valid enumeration choices, they are categories that can be used to implement popup lists.

If we were to traverse the graph we would begin with COUNTRIES and reach the [edge](_edge.md) that connects it with EUROPE using the [section](_predicate_section-of.md) [predicate](_predicate.md). Since sections are ignored, we continue and reach ITALY: that is a valid choice, because the [predicate](_predicate.md) is [enumeration-of](_predicate_enum-of.md).

Now suppose we want to create an enumeration that uses the COUNTRIES graph, but only includes a subset of the elements, this can be done by using the [path](_path.md) [edge](_edge.md) property and the [bridge-of](_predicate_bridge-of) [predicate](_predicate.md):

![GraphEnumBridge](/Users/milko/Local/Development/Projects/EUFGIS/data-dictionary-management/docs/GraphEnumBridge.png)

In the above example we want to create the MY-ENUM enumeration that only includes ITALY and INDIA. We do the following:

- We create an edge between COUNTRIES and MY-ENUM with the [bridge-of](_predicate_bridge-of.md) [predicate](_predicate.md). This means that when traversing the graph using MY-ENUM as the reference graph, we shall ignore the COUNTRIES node,
- We traverse the graph to the EUROPE and ASIA [sections](_predicate_section-of.md) where we simply append the MY-ENUM reference to the [path](_path.md) property of the [edges](_edge.md) that connect the nodes we are interested of: in our case ITALY and INDIA.

This way we have the following advantages:

- We reduce the number of edges.
- We can use existing enumerations in the user interface when creating new graphs that share branches.
- If the order of traversal is not important, we can reach all the elements of a specific graph only by querying the path property.

The same mechanism is valid for [object](_type_object.md) structures: the [property-of](_predicate_property-of.md) [predicate](_predicate.md) replaces the [enumeration-of](_predicate_enum-of.md) one.

Graphs could be used also to organise user interface elements, such as forms, disclosure sections and other structured display elements by adding new descriptors.
