#### Huber value variance



------
###### The variance of the ratio of under-bark sapwood cross-sectional area to subtended leaf area in a branch across all measured trees



------
The variance of the Huber values for the apical branches of 10 measured adult dominant or co-dominant trees sampled either inside or in the vicinity of the representative circular plot with a radius of 15 m. The ratio of under-bark sapwood cross-sectional area to the leaf area distal to the cross-section is a measure of allocation of assimilates to build either leaf area for photosynthesis or sapwood (i.e., wood capable of conducting water) to supply the leaves with water. A tree with high Huber values is efficient in providing support to the leaves, but may not invest in high leaf areas. The Huber value is determined on one branch for each of the 10 measufred trees.
