###### The SMA indicator is used to detect and monitor agricultural drought, which is one of three main types of drought that are defined according to the variables of the hydrological cycle. SMA expresses the deviation of actual SMI from its long term mean . The baseline period for SMA is 1995 to the last available full year. SMA is negative when soil moisture is lower than the reference baseline. The following classification can be applied: SMA<-1.0: mild drought; SMA<-1.5: severe drought; SMA<-2: extreme drought

LISFLOOD is a hydrological rainfall runoff model which has been developed by the JRC of the European Commission in order to reproduce the hydrology of large and trans national European river catchments (de Roo et al., 2000; van der Knijff et al., 2008), and which currently runs operationally within the Copernicus European Flood Awareness System (EFAS, http://www.efas.eu/). Input data for the LISFLOOD model include daily meteorological observations for the European continent, updated with a two day delay, which are obtained from the JRC’s MARS AGRI4CAST database1 , and which are extended for seven days using numerical 1 http://agri4cast.jrc.ec.europa.eu/DataPortal/ Copernicus European Drought Observatory (EDO): http://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ © European Commission, 2019. 3 weather forecasts produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The LISFLOOD model simulates soil moisture in two surface layers (skin layer and root zone) separately for forested and other layers. These four soil moisture layers are averaged daily to derive a single mean root zone soil moisture conditions to be successively standardized to 1.
