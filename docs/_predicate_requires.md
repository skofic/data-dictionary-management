###### The source node requires the destination node.



------
This predicate indicates that the *source* node *requires* the *destination* node. This means that in order to operate the source node, it is necessary to have access to destination node. This predicate is used to signal that one descriptor requires another descriptor. For instance *temperature* might require *date* in order for the measurement to be put into context.
