###### The mean of the sapwood area across all measured trees



------
The mean of the values of the sapwood area across 10 measured adult dominant or co-dominant trees sampled either inside or in the vicinity of the representative circular plot with a radius of 15 m. The sapwood area is based on the measurement of the length of the sapwood estimated from a wood core collected at breast height (1.3 m). This sapwood area is the calculated (in cm2) using the Trunk circumference.
