### chr_AvSapWoodAreaTrunk



------
#### Sapwood area trunk mean



------
###### The sapwood area of the tree at 1.30m height (breast height) based on the measurement of the length of the sapwood on the wood core collected in each of the 10 Functional Subset trees per plot.



------
Sapwood areas is calculated from:

- the under-bark total lenght of the core measured on the tree ring core after collection.
- the sapwood lenght measured on the tree ring core after collection.
- the bark lenght measured on the tree ring core after collection.

The calculation of sapwood area is weighted by the value of the breast height trunk circumference.
