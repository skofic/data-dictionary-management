[ISO 639-5]([ISO 639-5 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-5)) defines *alpha-3* (3-letter) codes, called *collective codes*, that identify language families and groups. The standard does not cover all language families used by linguists. The languages covered by a group code need not be linguistically related, but may have a geographic relation, or category relation (such as [Creoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_people "Creole people")).
