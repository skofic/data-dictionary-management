### _provider



------
#### Data provider



------
###### Name and contact of the people who provided the data definition.



------
This list of references should be used to provide all the *sources* of the *data definition*. This information can be useful when further information is needed.

The minimum information should be the name and the e-mail, if available. One can also add comments and other information if relevant.



------
```json
{
	"_data_provider": [
		"John Smith <j.smith@someinstitute.edu>",
		"Robert Frost <enquiries@knoweverything.com> Just for very difficult questions.",
		"Tree Institute - 5, Oak Drive, Massachussets,USA"
	]
}
```
The above example contains a list of three contacts. The first one contains a valid e-mail format string, the second adds a comment at the end, and the last one includes a mailing address.
