#### GRACE Total Water Storage (TWS) Anomaly.

###### This index is used for detecting and monitoring long-term hydrological drought conditions.

The *Total Water Storage (TWS) Anomaly* indicator that is implemented in the [Copernicus Global Drought Observatory (GDO)](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/php/index.php?id=1000) is used for determining the occurrence of long-term hydrological drought conditions, which arise when the TWS reaches values lower than usual. This quantity is often used as a proxy of groundwater drought. The [TWS Anomaly indicator](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/factsheets/factsheet_grace_tws_anomaly.pdf) in GDO is computed as anomalies of GRACE-derived TWS data - which are produced by the Center for Space Research (CSR) at the University of Texas at Austin, as scaled by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) (available at: https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/tellus/L3/gracefo/land_mass/RL06/).
