###### Average of the Annual Sum of Gross Primary Productivity.



------
Remotely sensed average of the annual sum of GCU Gross Primary Productivity in kg of C/m2.The monthly average is first calculated for the GCU area defined with the polygon of GCU boundaries. Then the sum is realised for all month of a year and divided by the number of year in the time series (2003-2021 here). Beware that for some GCU there are no shapefile available so that the average Land surface temperature over a 5km buffer around the GCU coordinate is taken.
