###### Average of yearly Gross Primary Productivity



------
Average annual sum of gross primary productivity (GPP) for the whole GCU, to establish the typical photosynthetic activity of vegetation. This value is obtained by summing all months and divided by the number of years in the time series (2003-2021 here). The GPP (kg of C/m2/day) corresponds to the amount of carbon that enters the ecosystem per unit surface and time. This value is derived from the sattelite MODIS at 1 km resolution that provides the fraction of light intercepted by the canopy and a model of photosynthesis that converts the intercepted light in to a carbon assimilation. This makes it possible to define the amount of energy available for the plant to function (respiration) and the amount available for growth (net primary productivity).
