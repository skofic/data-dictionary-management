#### Nucleotide diversity (sequence length)

###### Mean number of nucleotide substitutions per site between any two randomly selected DNA sequences in a population.



------
Nucleotide diversity measures the degree of polymorphism within a population and is defined as the average number of nucleotide differences per site between any two DNA sequences chosen randomly from the selected population. This parameter is a measure of genetic variation and is similar to expected heterozygosity.
