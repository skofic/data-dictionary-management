#### Leaf turgor loss point



------
###### The water potential at which leaves lose turgor.

Turgor loss point is an index of drought resistance and it is measured by osmometry on extracted sap. Tree level data.

This tree level property can also be averaged across trees to provide an equivalent GCU-level estimate (with associated variance).
