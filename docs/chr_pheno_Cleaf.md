#### Leaf hydraulic capacitance



------
###### The change in leaf relative water content RWC per unit change in water potential.



------
Hydraulic capacitance is an index of drought resistance and it is measured by weight loss under standard conditions. Tree level data.



------
This tree level property can also be averaged across trees to provide an equivalent GCU-level estimate (with associated variance).
