#### Population's contribution to molecular diversity within populations

###### Contribution of one population to the total diversity due to its own diversity



------
A molecular diversity partition of total gene diversity into diversity per se and distinctivness using molecular markers. Then the contribution of each population to the total (global) diversity is computed by removing one population at a time. This index refers to the population diversity per se (variation within populations). The measure is relative to the dataset analysed simultaneously and changes when new GCUs are added to the dataset. The index was calculated with metapop2 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.13015). Reference: Petit et al. 1998 (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.96489.x).
