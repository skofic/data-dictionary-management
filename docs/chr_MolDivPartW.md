#### Population contribution to molecular diversity within-component

###### Contribution of target population to global molecular diversity per se.



------
A molecular diversity partition into diversity per se and distinctivness is defined by using molecular markers. Then the contribution of each population to the global diversity is computed by removing one population at a time. This statistics refers to the population diversity per se. The measure is relative to the dataset analysed simultaneously and changes when new GCUs are added to the dataset.
