#### Link predicate



------
###### Link predicates are used in edges that can be traversed by a single path and that have a single level



------
Predicates are used in two main edge objects: [edges](_edge.md) and [links](_link.md).

[Links](_link.md) are used to *connect one or more nodes* to *another node*, this forms a *single level hierarchy*. This type of relationship is equivalent to having an *array of connections* as a *property*, however, implementing this relationship using predicates allows us to *add an additional dimention* to the *relationship*.
