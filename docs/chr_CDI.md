#### Combined Drought Indicator

###### CDI is a combined drought indicator aiming to identify areas affected by agricultural droughts. It contains meteorological, hydrological and satellite-derived biophysical variables and distinguishes between five drought levels: 1) Watch, 2) Warning, 3) Alert, 4) partial recovery, 5) full recovery

The Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) identifies areas with the potential to suffer agricultural drought, areas where the vegetation is already affected by drought conditions, and areas in the process of recovery to normal conditions after a drought episode. The CDI is based on the cause effect relationship for agricultural drought, whereby a shortage of precipitation leads to a soil moisture deficit, which in turn results in a reduction of vegetation productivity. The indicator is computed by combining anomalies of precipitation, soil moisture and satellite-measured plant growth - as measured by, respectively, the EDO drought indicators Standardized Precipitation Index, Soil Moisture Anomaly, and FAPAR Anomaly – using a classification scheme consisting of five drought levels (Watch, Warning, Alert, partial recovery, full recovery).
