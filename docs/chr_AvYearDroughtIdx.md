###### The number of days of the year with the soil relative water content below the treshold of 0.4. Indicator of moderate drought with no or low influence on survival

The relative soil water content in the rooting zone is a key indicator of drought. In particular, when the standardised value falls below the threshold of 0.4, trees have been shown to respond by limiting fluxes and losing turgor. The SurEau and Medfate models were used to calculate the daily water content and extract the annual number of days when the Relative Extractable soil Water (i.e. water available for the trees) was below the threshold of 0.4, then the annual average of the metric was taken to indicate the water deficit.
