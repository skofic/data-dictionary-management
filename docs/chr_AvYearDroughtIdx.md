###### The number of days of the year with the soil relative water content below the treshold of 0.4

The relative soil water content in the rooting zone is a key indicator of drought. In particular, when its value falls below the threshold of 0.4, trees have been shown to respond by limiting fluxes and losing turgor. The SurEau model was used to calculate the daily water content and extract the annual number of days when the Relative soil Water  was below the threshold of 0.4. This is used as a yearly metric of forest water deficit.
