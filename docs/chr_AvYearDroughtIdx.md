### chr_AvYearDroughtIdx



------
#### Average yearly drought index



------
###### The average of the number of days of the year with the soil relative water content below the treshold of 0.4.



------
The relative soil water content in rooting zone is a key indicator of drought. In particular when the standardized value passes below of treshold 0.4 it has been shown that trees react by limiting fluxes and loosing turgor. The SurEau and Medfate models were used to compute the daily water content and extract the yearly number of days when REW was below the trehsold of 0.4 Then, yearly average of the metric was taken to indicate the water deficit.
