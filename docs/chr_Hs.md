###### Genetic diversity (Hs) measures genetic variation within a single subpopulation. It quantifies the probability that two randomly selected alleles from the subpopulation are different under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

Genetic diversity (Hs) is a measure of the genetic variation within a single subpopulation under random mating. It quantifies the probability that two randomly selected alleles from the subpopulation are different. The value ranges from 0 (no  genetic variability) to 1 (high genetic variability). Hs was calculated in R packege hierfstat.
