DESCRIPTION

------

Because of their relative simplicity, [reference ellipsoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ellipsoid) are used as a preferred surface on which [geodetic network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_network "Geodetic network")computations are performed and point coordinates such as [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude"), [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude"), and [elevation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation "Elevation") are defined.

In the context of standardization and geographic applications, a *geodesic reference ellipsoid* is the mathematical model used as foundation by [spatial reference system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system "Spatial reference system") or [geodetic datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum "Geodetic datum") definitions.
