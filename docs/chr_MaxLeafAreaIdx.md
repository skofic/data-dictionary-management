###### Maximum of the Leaf Area Index



------
Average maximum leaf area index (LAI) for the whole GCU (exactly the quantile 90 of yearly maximum to avoid outlier data), is a very good indicator of the state of the forest studied, mainly in terms of leaf density and forest development conditions.  The LAI is an indicator of leaf area (one side) relative to the soil surface. I.e., a LAI of 2 represents a leaf area of 2 m2 for 1 m2 of soil. This gives an overview of the density of the plant cover and therefore the extent of energy and gas exchange between the plant and its environment.These data come from the reflectance of the top of the canopy measured with satellite data at 0.5km resolution (from MODIS).
