#### Above-ground biomass average

###### Average amount of living biomass (organic matter) stored in vegetation above the soil including stem, stump, branches, bark, seeds and foliage, expressed as dry weight

Above-ground biomass is here referred to in terms of biomass density, i.e., the amount of living biomass per unit area. Accordingly, this quantity is here expressed in units of mass of dry matter per unit ground area, i.e., Mg ha-1 (Megagrams per hectare), which is equivalent to tons per hectare. This value is the average for the conservation unit geographic shape.
