Effective population size (Ne) defines the size of an ideal population that would result in the same level of inbreeding, genetic drift or additive variance as that of the population under study, or more simply, it can be thought of as the number of individuals in a population that contribute equally to the next generation of offspring. Ne is important in conservation genetics because it quantifies the rate at which a population is losing genetic variation and is therefore used to assess the health and viability of populations in both the short and long term. Different approaches for Ne calculation will be used, representing the kind of evolution (polymorphism or inbreeding) and the term of evolution (long-term or current). Generally, the effective size of a population is considerably less than the census size. It is not straightforward to compute Ne in forest tree and most estimates are not reliable, except for small, isolated populations, for example GCUs with less than 1000 reproducing trees (this number should include the reproducing trees outside the GCU if there is gene flow).
