The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR, sometimes also noted fAPAR or fPAR ) is the fraction of the incoming solar radiation in the photosynthetically active radiation spectral region that is absorbed by a photosynthetic organism , typically describing the light absorption across an integrated plant canopy. This biophysical variable is directly related to the primary productivity of photosynthesis and some models use it to estimate the assimilation of carbon dioxide in vegetation in conjunction with the leaf area index . FPAR can also be used as an indicator of the state and evolution of the vegetation cover; with this function, it advantageously replaces the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), provided it is itself properly estimated.
