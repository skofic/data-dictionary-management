###### A macrolanguage is a book-keeping mechanism for the ISO 639 international standard for language codes.



> DESCRIPTION
> 
> ------

[Macrolanguages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639_macrolanguage) are established to assist mapping between different sets of ISO language codes. Specifically, there may be a many-to-one correspondence between [ISO 639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3 "ISO 639-3"), intended to identify all the thousands of languages of the world, and either of two other sets, [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1 "ISO 639-1"), established to identify languages in computer systems, and [ISO 639-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-2 "ISO 639-2"), which encodes a few hundred languages for library cataloguing and bibliographic purposes. When such many-to-one ISO 639-2 codes are included in an ISO 639-3 context, they are called "macrolanguages" to distinguish them from the corresponding individual languages of ISO 639-3.
