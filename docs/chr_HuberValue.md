###### The ratio of under-bark wood cross-sectional area to subtended leaf area in a branch.



------
The Huber Value is the ratio of sapwood cross-sectional area to leaf area above the sapwood cross-section. It is an index of investment of dry matter in either leaves or wood. It represents the investment in the production of branch wood required for the conduction of water towards the transpiring leaves subtended by that cross-section. A high Huber value indicate an conservative plant, i.e., a plant that does not develop a large leaf area but rather prefers to build a large supporting wooden structure. A low Huber value indicates an acquisitive plant, with large leaf area, but low water supply capacity. It is measured in the apical branches of each tree. Tree level data.
