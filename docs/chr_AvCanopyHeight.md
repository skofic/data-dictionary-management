#### Average GCU canopy height



------
###### Averaged canopy height over the polygon in meters.

Remotely sensed averaged to canopy length (m) of the GCU.  The value come from the beam of the GEDI lidar falling inside the GCU area defined with the polygon (shapefile) of GCU boundaries. If the polygon is not available, the beam falling if a 5km buffer around the coordinate of the GCU is taken.
