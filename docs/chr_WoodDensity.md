Wood density is an index of investments of dry biomass in wood. It represents the biomass invested per unit of wood volume. A plant with high values of wood density is a conservative plant. A plant with high values of wood density is an acquisitive plant. Wood density helps to maintain mechanical support. However, high wood density results in low capacity to transport water and store carbohydrates. It is obtained by weighing and following determination of volume. It is measured at the base of apical branches of each tree.
