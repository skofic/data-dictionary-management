#### Specific leaf area mean

###### The mean of the ratio of half of the total area of a fresh leaf to its dry mass across all measured trees



------
The mean of the values of specific leaf area for the apical leaves of 10 measured adult dominant or co-dominant trees sampled either inside or in the vicinity of the representative circular plot with a 15 m radius. Specific leaf area (SLA) is a measure of the return of photosynthetic assimilates via leaf surface display per unit leaf biomiass investment. Leaves with high SLA are said to be acquisitive leaves. They are photosynthetically more productive per unit of mass invested and per unit of time, but they generally have a shorter lifespan, which lowers their cumulative return.
