###### Micro-topography assessed in the representative circular plot within the GCU



------
Micro-topography is assessed at the scale of the representative circular plot with a radius of 15 m according to an index ranging from 1 to 3:

1 = convex
2 = neutral
3 = concave

The index allows to determine whether there is more in- or outflow of water which has an influence on the soil available water capacity. For example, there is more water inflow if the topography is concave but there is more outflow if the topography is convex.
