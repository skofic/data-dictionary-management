#### Decimal longitude



------
*Decimal longitude* represents the *longitude* of a *point* in *decimal degrees*. Longitude is defined as the *angle* between the *Prime Meridian* (which passes through Greenwich, England) and a *line* that *passes through the point and the center of the Earth*. It ranges from:

- **+180 degrees** east of the Prime Meridian
- **0 degrees** at the Prime Meridian
- **-180 degrees** west of the Prime Meridian

Longitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS) can be converted to decimal format using the formula:

`Decimal Degrees = Degrees + (Minutes / 60) + (Seconds / 3600)`
