### chr_trend_AvLeafAreaIdx



------
#### Trend (temporal dynamics) in annual mean of GCU averaged LAI



------
###### Temporal trends of the annual mean remotely sensed LAI



------
Slope of the relationship between yearly mean remotely sensed LAI over the GCU and time  (LAI/year).

Beware that  for some GCUs there are no shapefile available so that the average Land  surface temperature over a 5 km buffer around the GCU coordinate is taken.
