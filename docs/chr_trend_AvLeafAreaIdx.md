###### Temporal trends of the Leaf Area Index



------
Average variation in leaf area, giving an idea of the annual dynamics of the vegetation. If the value is positive, then there is a tendency for leaf area to increase, often a sign of improved environmental conditions. If the value is negative, this indicates a decrease in leaf area, often implying greater stress. The leaf area index (LAI) is an indicator of leaf area (one side) relative to the soil surface. I.e., a LAI of 2 represents a leaf area of 2 m2 for 1 m2 of soil. This gives an overview of the density of the plant cover and therefore the extent of energy and gas exchange between the plant and its environment.These data come from the reflectance of the top of the canopy measured with satellite data at 0.5km resolution (from MODIS).
