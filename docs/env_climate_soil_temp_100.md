### env_climate_soil_temp_100



------
#### Soil temperature from 28 to 100cm.



------
###### Temperature of the soil in layer 3 (28-100 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.



------
The surface is at 0 cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them.

It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer.
