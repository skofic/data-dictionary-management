###### Vertical distance from soil surface to the bottom of the excavated pit or of the soil auger core



------
The soil depth is determined either by excavating a pit or by extracting a soil core with a soil auger to the depth at which rocks are found or the extraction of further soil is impossible.

It can be used together with soil texture to calculate the amount of water stored in the soil that can be utilised by trees.
