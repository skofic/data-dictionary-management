The *FAPAR* indicator, that is implemented in the [Copernicus European Drought Observatory (EDO)](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/php/index.php?id=1000), is used to detect and monitor the impacts on vegetation growth and productivity of environmental stress factors, especially plant water stress due to drought. The [FAPAR Anomaly](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/factsheets/factsheet_fapar.pdf) indicator is computed as deviations of the satellite-measured biophysical variable Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR, sometimes written as fAPAR or FPAR), composited for 10-day intervals, from its long-term mean values. FAPAR is one of the 50 so-called “Essential Climate Variables” (ECVs) that have been defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as being both feasible for global climate observation, and important to support the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Bojinski et al., 2014).
