### chr_trend_AvLandSurfTemp



------
#### Trend (temporal dynamics) in annual mean of GCU averaged Land surface temperature



------
###### Temporal trends of the remotely sensed annual mean land surface temperature.



------
Slope of the relationship between remotely sensed annual mean land surface temperature of the GCU and time (Â°C/year).

Beware that for some GCUs there are no shapefile available so that the average Land surface temperature over a 5 km buffer around the GCU coordinate is taken.
