The SurEau model estimate soil and plant water status at an hourly time step and derived the hydraulic safety margins and  the risk of hydraulic failure. It is based on an integrated soil-plant hydraulic model solving the water balance of different plant compartments (canopy and stem, roots and three soil layers)using a semi-implicit numerical resolution. It relies on hourly climate variable and on measurable soil and plant traits.
