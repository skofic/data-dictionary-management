This data structure is implemented using the [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com) edge record, in particular:\n\n- The [key](_key) property is required and should be the MD5 hash of the *concatenation* of the [source term reference](_from) , [predicate](_predicate) and [destination term reference](_to) properties separated by a slash (`/`) token. This means that there can be only one edge connecting the source and destination nodes with a specific predicate.\n- The [predicate](_predicate) property is required, it indicates the nature or function of the relationship.\n- The [path](_path) property is also required in order to allow more than one path to share the same source, predicate and destination combination."},
