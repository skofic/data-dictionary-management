If you want to enforce the use of enumeration B, even passing through enumeration A, you can connect controlled vocabulary A elements with the bridge predicate and connect the related enumeration B elements wuth the *enumeration* predicate. This way when you search for an element in enumeration A, you will get back the corresponding element of enumeration B."}
