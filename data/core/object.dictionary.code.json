This object features the following [descriptors](_term_descriptor):\n\n- [Namespace identifier](_nid): The namespace is an identifier that is *prefixed* to the [local identifier](_lid), separated with a colon (`_`) *token*, to form the [global identifier](_gid) which is the *unique identifier* of a *term* in the *data dictionary*. The value of this namespace is the *term global identifier*. This field is *optional*, but any term which *does not* have a namespace will be considered a *root level namespace*. Once set, or omitted, no change can be made to this field.\n- [Local identifier](_lid): Terms are *uniquely identified* by their [global identifier](_gid), which is the concatenation of the [namespace identifier](_nid) and *this field*, separated by an underscore (`_`) *token*. The value of this field is a string code that should *not include* characters that are *not allowed* in *variables* or *database fields*. The field is *required* and once the value has been set, it *cannot be modified*.\n- [Global identifier](_gid): Terms are *uniquely identified* by *this field*, which is the concatenation of the [namespace identifier](_nid) and the [local identifier](_lid), separated by an underscore (`_`) *token*. The value of this field is *computed* before *storing* the *term* in the *database*, and once its value has been set, it *cannot be modified*.\n- [All identifiers](_aid): This property is a *list* of *strings* containing all the *codes*, intended as *local identifiers*, that *reference* the *term*. The [local identifier](_lid) must also be *included* in the set. The *field* is used to *include* eventual *synonym local identifiers*.\n- [Provider identifiers](_pid): This property is a *list* of *strings* containing all the *codes* or *field names* used by *metadata* or *data providers* when *submitting datasets*. The field can be useful to identify data types in undocumented datasets.\n- [Name](_name): *Local*, *native* or *original name* that is *assigned* or *identifies* the term. This is generally used to record the *official name*, without the reference to the language."},
