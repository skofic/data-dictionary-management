Ne is important in conservation genetics because it quantifies the rate at which a population is losing genetic variation and is therefore used to assess the health and viability of populations in both the short and long term. Different approaches for Ne calculation will be used, representing the kind of evolution (polymorphism or inbreeding) and the term of evolution (long-term or current). Generally, the effective size of a population is considerably less than the census size.
