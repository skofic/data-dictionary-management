This data structure is implemented using the [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com) edge record, in particular:\n\n- The [key](_key) property is required and should be the MD5 hash of the *concatenation* of the [source term reference](_from) , [predicate](_predicate) and [destination term reference](_to) properties separated by a slash (`/`) token. This means that there can be only one edge connecting the source and destination nodes with a specific predicate.\n- The [predicate](_predicate) property is required, it indicates the nature or function of the relationship.\n- The [path](_path) property is also required in order to allow more than one path to share the same source, predicate and destination combination."},"_examples":{"iso_639_3_eng":"Edge example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"_key\": \"20103dc79d7f368e2624a0f781c31e05\",\n\t\"_from\": \"terms/source_node\",\n\t\"_to\": \"terms/destination_node\",\n\t\"_predicate\": \"_edge_predicate_enum-of\",\n\t\"_path\": [\"destination_node\", \"other_node\"]\n}\n```\n\nThis example represents an *edge* that connects `source_node` to `destination_node` making `source_node` an *enumeration element* of the `destination_node` *controlled vocabulary*.
